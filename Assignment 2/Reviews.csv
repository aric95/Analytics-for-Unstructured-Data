0,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,2020 vintage acquired during the pandemic. It was everything I'd hoped it would be and worth the drive to track it down. Wonderful aroma and such a smooth taste. Very few live up to the hype but this one did.,5
1,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Long time waiting to tick this one, and I have to say - pretty underwhelmed. Its delicious as far as maple syrup goes, but overall it was lacking in complexity. Barrel was light and not much else. Nice mouth feel and long finish.",4.56
2,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"This review is for the 2019 batch. It was bottle number 43, tasted as part of a dinner at Toppling Goliath. Poured as dinner was served, thick and almost black, allowed to warm and enjoyed as dessert. On the nose, bourbon and maple syrup. Thick mouth-feel, and full of flavor. I have had the 2020 version on tap, so comparing the two is difficult, however I think the 2019 aged nicely and was, in my opinion, the better of the two.",5
3,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Supreme maple OD! Soooo easy drinking & well-tasty. History in the making when finally scoring this one! (for the record, tried both 2019 and 2020 at the same time, the latter one being the best... I think)",5
4,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"I have now had 4 different years of KBBS and continue to feel this beer is in a realm of its own. The look is as dark as burnt motor oil. The smell is filled with maple, coffee, bourbon, and stout. Outside of 2020 the taste is super sticky with a huge mouth feel.",5
5,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,2020 Bottle.,5
6,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Some burnt sugar and a bit of licorice. Nice dark fruits, too. Flavor has plenty of sugar and malt sweetness. Lots of caramel, toffee, and maple syrup. Nice bourbon and vanilla, too. Good dark fruit character, cocoa powder, and decent coffee. Good stuff.",4.45
7,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Bottle @ Presidential Suite. Thanks, Adam. Redemption from Bully Guppy. Black pour with a finger of tan foam. Tons of bourbon, maple syrup, and vanilla. Nice coffee, cocoa powder, and toffee. Some burnt sugar and a bit of licorice. Nice dark fruits, too. Flavor has plenty of sugar and malt sweetness. Lots of caramel, toffee, and maple syrup. Nice bourbon and vanilla, too. Good dark fruit character, cocoa powder, and decent coffee. Good stuff.",4.15
8,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"The look is great, and then it's downhill after that.
This beer has so much coffee and sweet flavors that I cannot taste the stout....the beer aspect of it. It needs to be in another (new) category, because as a stout beer it really just isn't other than (maybe) it's color. Now, if those coffee, maple, bourbon, et al flavors came from the malt or wood, then bravo. But they didn't.",2.88
9,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"This dark nectar poured like a heavenly scented motor oil into my glass. Its like someone took my morning coffee, maple syrup and best bourbon and combined them into this once in a lifetime treat. I could still smell the maple syrup days later from the EMPTY bottle sitting on my desk.",5
10,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Is this the best beer in the world, many would argue that is true. While trying on draft at Toppling Goliath, it’s hard to imagine the rich smooth sweet maple balanced by coffee could be all be pulled off the nose, staining the glass. And the flavor and taste to be met with fireworks from the grand finale.",5
11,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"I had this for the first time in 2020. I was outside and it was cold and when this hit my lips, I drifted off to heaven. The hype is real with this one!!!",4.85
12,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Rich dark brown with a thin finger of creamy-looking mocha head. Settles relatively quickly into a nice, lasting cap and wisp. Almost no lacing.",4.51

16,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,2020 on draft at Toppling Goliath.,4.9
17,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2019 KBBS
Look: black syrup, no head, super thick
Smell: huge maple notes up front, subtle barrel and coffee in the middle, finishes with maple soaked coffee
Taste: big maple, bourbon and coffee flavors. Front is maple, then comes coffee and bourbon, finishes with a maple bourbon blast
Overall not as good as the nose
Feel: super thick yet well carbonated... well balanced and lingers for ages",4.9
18,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,2019 draft and bottle.,4.99
19,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Smell: early morning pancakes and coffee before work that wakes you up
Taste: liquifies buttery maple pancakes and hot coffee with some snake bite in it.
Feel: Like that Scene in there will be blood when the oil explodes everywhere. Tar.
Overall: Magnificent worth its weight in gold",5
20,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2019 vintage. Pours a very dark brown color with noticeable sugars coating the glass. Lots of coffee and maple in the nose, not much barrel or heat at all. Very rich and coating mouthfeel with a lot of layers in the flavor. Coffee, espresso, maple, vanilla are in good balance. Not much bourbon or oak if at all noticeable. Really great beer as it's very hard to pull off this many flavors and layers without a dominant flavor. Just missed it a little with not much bourbon or barrel presence aside from the vanilla notes.",4.63
21,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Reviewing 2019 vintage. This pours thick and close to black with unsurprisingly poor head retention (that being said, I drank this out of a taster glass). Does not stop the nose from jumping out of the glass. Huge coffee and maple, as advertised, masking any potential aroma from the barrel. That trend continues into the taste - difficult to find the barrel even when looking intently for it. The coffee is very pleasant and plays well with the maple, which presents authentically and not as a general sweetness. Thick, smooth mouthfeel (again, no surprises here). Overall, this would receiving a rating bump if it wasn't meant to be a barrel aged beer. In that respect, it falls short, as the adjuncts and texture are the real star of the show here. Very cool to try, but not worth the price of admission these days.",4.52
22,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2018 version. Poured dark with a small head. Smell was maple coffee with a hint of bourbon. Very smooth drinking and taste was wow - chocolate, coffee, maple, and a touch of sweetness. One of the best beers I've ever tried.",4.99
23,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"A (very expensive) draft pour at TG on release day Dec. 7, 2019.",4.99
24,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2016 Silver Wax. Aroma has whiskey, maple, toffee and umami. Taste has wood barrel, umami, dark fruit, maple and toffee. Bitter cacao and coffee aftertaste.",4.8
25,Marshmallow Handjee,"Like slow dancing with Aretha Franklin, this one has soul. Hot damn, I feel like I can lasso a T. rex. Uhhh huh, I can hurdle that St. Louis arc…",4.57
26,Marshmallow Handjee,"dec. 14, 2019
That was an awesome taste explosion. Big smell, beautifull mouthfeel. Bit on the sweet side, but in good balance with the barrel. Smooth and bit alcoholic in the end.",4.78
27,Marshmallow Handjee,I can’t say enough about this. The bourbon barrel and the vanilla beans are balanced to perfection. The sweetness is cut by the smooth velvet flavor. World class beer and one of the best vanilla stouts out there. It’s one of those beers you must seek out once. Or many times.,5
28,Marshmallow Handjee,The Best. It really doesn't disappoint. The vanilla works flawlessly with the barrel presence and the base beer. I chased this for a long time and trying it was worth the wait.,5
29,Marshmallow Handjee,I've had a few different years of this and they're all fantastic. It's worth the drive to Indiana to have a chance at landing it. I've had the last few years of this and they're all superb.,4.63
30,Marshmallow Handjee,"2019 Handjee, poured from cellar temp into a plastic glass. Shared with friends spread out in my backyard",4.43
31,Marshmallow Handjee,"2019 Vintage
L - Pitch black. Looks like motor oil. Small amount of light brown head
S - Vanilla infused brownie batter that has been marinating in bourbon
F - Silky, thick
T - Vanilla upfront followed by a bourbon soaked brownie ball. An incredibly long finish that is followed up with some heat from the barrel
O - A beer that lives up to the hype. Absolutely worth the price of admission.",4.98
32,Marshmallow Handjee,"I am going to start off by saying I like this beer and would happily have it again, but the number 2 beer in the world? Not a chance! Shimmering jet black with a brown cap that fades into a ring. The nose is the star of the beer: huge vanilla and bourbon, toasty rustic oak, dark chocolate fudge, roasted malts, date, a hint of coffee, brown sugar and molasses. Taste really does well to accentuate the tannins in the wood with the bourbon and vanilla as the excavators, maltwork is robust and characteristic of the base, sweet dark lord flavors that were detected in the nose poke through, on the sweeter side of the style for sure. Feel is very warm, full, heavy, viscous, and robust without getting syrupy, wonderful but sweeter feeling, barrel character is great. The best variant yet I have tried",4.59
33,Marshmallow Handjee,"This is the most ridiculously well-tasting beverage I've tasted in my entire life. Lots of massive chocolate, non-synthetic marsmallow, vanilla, bourbon- thick body. Insane! Both 2018 and 2015.",5
34,Marshmallow Handjee,It's nothing short of absolute perfection. It's like drinking a liquid velvet smore complete with campfire smoke. Love the stuff just wish it wasn't so impossible to get ahold of.,5
35,Marshmallow Handjee,2018 version poured into a tulip. This beer deserves every bit of hype associated with it in my opinion. Wonderfully thick. Marshmallow and chocolate delight with booze knocking on the door. I hope I have another chance to try this beer sometime.,5
36,Marshmallow Handjee,"Wow was this overrated. I couldn't beleive it when I saw that this was my variant. Had a blind BBA Vanilla beer tasting with family. Handjee, Bourbon County Vanilla, Fundamental Observation, Vlad Vanilla & French Vanilla Militia.

37,Marshmallow Handjee,Tastes like burnt Vanilla Coke aged in gasoline barrels.,3.77
38,Marshmallow Handjee,Tastes like a barbeque pork chop dipped in vanilla icing. I do not understand this beer or the hype. I will not be hunting any more dark lord variant. Pass.,3.88
39,Marshmallow Handjee,"Jet black pour, dark tan head. The base Dark Lord aromas plus heavy vanilla and some oak. Wow.",4.74
40,Marshmallow Handjee,"Split the 2018 version with 2 friends. I'll blame the perpetual hype but IMHO this was just a pretty good vanilla stout. Not 5 times better than FO, certainly not 2-3 times as good as Henna marshmallow. Yes the vanilla balance was perfect but honestly it started to wobble a bit as it warmed up. Not worth the price tag, hoping for a different variant this year.",4.42
41,Marshmallow Handjee,2017 vintage; drank 6/2/17 @ Harvest Hop Haus.,4.92
42,Marshmallow Handjee,"For purposes of the review, both 2017 and 2018 were sampled together.",5
43,Marshmallow Handjee,"L: pours thick and pitch black with no head
S: marshmallow, vanilla, chocolate and barrel. Mighty fine
T: just like the nose and all in harmony
F: smooth, thick and creamy
O: world class",4.9
44,Marshmallow Handjee,2018 vintage. About six months from bottling.,4.35
45,Marshmallow Handjee,Can cross this whale off the list! Mouthfeel on this beer is outstanding. If you have a chance to sample or get this beer I highly recommend it for sure!,4.94
46,Marshmallow Handjee,750 into a fff teku,4.96
47,Marshmallow Handjee,"Smells great, mouthfeel great.
Sweet sweet sweet. It is delicious. But i found, though delicious, it might be objectionable to drink a full glass due to the level of sweetness. I didn't get any barrel, mostly residual sugars. Nice beer, I don't find it elite.",4.59
48,Marshmallow Handjee,"2018 bottle(silver wax). The hype is real! Been wanting this for as long as I can remember. Glad I finally got a chance to try a hefty pour at a nice share. It stole the show around a bunch of BIG beers. It’s crazy how much this tastes like toasted marshmallow fluff. Zero heat, and smooth as hell.",4.99
49,Marshmallow Handjee,"Everything I love about barrel aged stouts. Thick, oily, coats the glass. Smells sweet, but not overly so. The taste follows with sweetness, barrel oak/vanilla flavors. Not overly sweet, with enough heat to balance it perfectly. (2017 Handjee)",4.94
50,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"This amazing beer combines tobacco, peppers, vanilla, and what tastes like brandy into the quintessential barrel aged beer that pours perfectly and combines amazing mouthfeel, carb and taste",4.75
51,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,2016 Vintage - Drank 02/24/21,4.15
52,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Bottle @ 10K + OT. Thanks, Jake. Black in color without much/any head. Crazy marshmallow and graham cracker nose. Lots of cinnamon, chocolate, and vanilla. Light spice, slight fruity brandy, and some caramel. Tastes like smores and cinnamon toast crunch. Crazy marshmallow, chocolate, and cinnamon. Dark chocolate, vanilla, and a subtle chile spiciness. Really solid.",4.29
53,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Tasted this double barrel aged multiple times for multiple years. This is an excellent stout that I welcome drinking just about any time I'd like a stout. However, this is simply not a 100 point beer. I'm convinced that the score for this beer is the result of scoring by locals employing local hype. But, very good beer none the less.",4
54,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"After 500+ stouts, this one is easily top 5. A bar to measure all other BA adjunct stouts (for me). Everything is spot on. Sweet-but-not-too-sweet, super balanced adjuncts, barrel-but-not-too-much-barrel, thick-but-not-THICC, etc.",4.9
55,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,Thanks to my new friends at the Cycle Barrel Aged Day bottle shared.,4.74
56,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.",4.09
57,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Pours motor-oil black with minimal head. Nose is seriously off, like a cross between an ashtray and burnt sesame candy. Booze is there, too, but largely overpowered. Taste is extremely muddled. Peppery spice, smokiness, minimal barrel presence, with a lot less sweetness than expected from the rum/apple brandy combo. Flavors blend much more pleasantly in the taste than the smell, the mouthfeel is pleasantly thick, but overall this was a real letdown.",3.8
58,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"B2, shared amongst friends.",4.26
59,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,Appearance - The beer poured a silky black color with a dark mocha colored head.,4.6
60,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"This is such a big beer and there is so much going on, it is great, but you can only consume about 4 oz before you're done or you get diabetes. Let's calm down on the ratings a little bit",4.01
61,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,2016 batch (#2) reviewed.,4.2
62,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Black color with dark mocha head. Aroma is really spice forward with lots of cinnamon, rum and booze. Taste is desserty with fudge, chili, cinnamon and some heat on the finish. Full bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Quite nice but not such a huge step ahead of the regular.",4.55
63,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Tasted from bottle. Pours black with beige head. Tasted against regular 16 Huna and 17 Bourbon BA Huna. Aroma of cinnamon, rum, almost a little nutty, some fruity notes and apple. Moderate to heavily sweet with mild bitterness. Lots of cinnamon, caramel, toffee, some chocolate and finishes with a moderate chili burn. You do get some rum barrel sweetness and just a hint of brandy. More intense and complex than the Huna and Bourbon Huna. Excellent!",4.68
64,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Pours a jet engine oil dark body with a mocha-hued head. The cacao and spice come aromas are strong, along with the booziness from the brandy and rum barrels. The taste is like no other stout I've had. Brandy and rum blend together nicely to add some complexity to the richness of the nibs. The chiles and cinnamon are very noticeable as well, but are balanced out by the chocolate and alcohol so it's never too overpowering. The chocolate and vanilla thicken this beer, and the heat of the chiles and brandy/rum leave a nice heat. Phenomenal beer that deserves the praise it's received.",4.99
65,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Pours one shade shy of black with not head, just a tight band around the shoulders. Nose reveals chocolate, peanut butter and a hit of cinnamon. Taste follows nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation, a hit of heat and a kiss of acidity. All and all a nice beer but I don't get too much of the barrel.",4.23
66,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Pours a thick, oily pitch black coloration with a small, creamy head. The beer downright sticks to the glass as you swirl it, leaving a short-lived film of dark beer and white lace. Smell is somewwhat subdued, pretty underwheming compared to the taste. Cinnamon is most noticeable, with a sort of odd earthy, musty, woody aroma being pretty dominant as well. Perhaps a hint of coconut there. Taste is quite complex, lots of chocolate and rum noticeable at first, with a decent bit of cinnamon and vanilla coming through as well. The chili really grows as you drink and the beer warms. Quite noticeable in the aftertaste in a really pleasant way. Quite a bit of warm boozyness there as well, but very smooth and mellow at the same time. Mouthfeel really is fantastic, very thick, sticky, almost oily and very smooth. I was considering waiting for CBS for my 100th review, but I think this one will do nicely. The barrel-aging really did wonders to the quite overrated Hunapuh here, adding a certain complexity from the brandy and rum notes along with making the chili stand out more and generally mellowing out the beer, creating a richer harmony. Still smells really weird though.",4.35
67,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Very Dark brown with a tan head. It appeared to be less thick on the pour particularly compared to Man Bear Pig which we had drank before this beer.
Boozy on the nose but not over powering which is just the way it finishes. Malt chocolate, slightly spicy, sweet molasses but not overly sweet. I liked the balance in flavors.",4.64
68,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,Poured into a tulip glass via bottle (2016 Edition),4.66
69,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,This review is for batch 2.,4.36
70,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,With so much talk about this being a disappointment This beer was fantastic. Has a slight chili smell. This is some chili up front followed by nice barrel flavor.some spice comes through and had a rich body. Overall really delicious.,4.44
71,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,Thanks much to chicagopubcrawler for making this one happen.,4.71
72,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"Batch 2, snifter, shared with my brother",4.73
73,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a very prominent and pleasant cinnamon and vanilla. Taste is also a prominent cinnamon and pleasant vanilla accent and prominent chili burn.,4.52

750ml bottle poured into a balloon glass",4.64
75,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Pours very dark black with a thin tan head on top, Smells of Cinnamon Toast Crunch soaked in Bourbon which I think is pretty nice. The taste of the beer has the cinnamon and the touch of spice in there along with the vanilla and chocolate. The feel is nice and silky, doesn't burn the throat or mouth from the adjuncts which is perfect. Overall it's an outstanding beer and was fortunate to try it finally.",4.34
76,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Big time grail for me. Vintage 2019 on tap at Bier Station, consumed and reviewed October 2021.",4.64
77,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Look - black thick and a nice tan rimming almost no head. Fantastic skimming
Smell - so much barrel with a great balance of vanilla, cinnamon, and chocolate
Taste - boozy with a fantastic blend of cinnamon vanilla chocolate. Nice woody caramel bba taste. Boozy
Feel - full body creamy with a slight carb
Overall - just incredible",4.74
78,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Had a friend surprise me with this, so excited to finally give it a try! Black body with a brown head. Aromas of the barrel fueling the cinnamon, vanilla, and cocoa to decent heights, peppers, rye and oak linger. Taste has the whiskey from the barrel merge well with the caramel, vanilla, cocoa, brown sugar and cinnamon, with the peppers, rye, and oak providing a beautiful contrasting wave. Almost has hints of cola as it warms. Feel is warm and more sturdy than the orignal, but the adjunct textures are dulled a bit, oak is a pleasant backbone. It is wonderful, but I have to admit the orignal abraxas still is first in my heart for the series.",4.53
79,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,February 5th: Side by side tasking with regular 2018 Abraxas. Low carbonation. A little barrel and pepper heat. Decent thickness. For me this is better than non BA but only marginally.,4.5
80,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Bottle @ Perennial. Crazy cinnamon sugar, coconut, and marshmallow on the nose. Lots of dark chocolate, vanilla, fudge, and whiskey. Damn. The cinnamon really makes the flavor for me. Great spice balances out the sweet chocolate, vanilla, and coconut. A touch of marshmallow and somewhat moderate rye/whiskey. Awesome beer.",4.3
81,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"On premise pour while picking up bottle from 2020 oznr lottery. Thick, spicy, sweet. Couldn’t be happier about this. King of Mexican chocolate beers",5
82,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Pours pitch black with tan head. Aroma is as expected. Roast, spice and booze. Flavor was a tad shallow. I was expecting more bold flavors considering. Overall, I expected more. Still, solid for what it is.",4
83,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,Excellent execution of the Mayan mocha style. The rye barrel spice marries wonderfully with the adjunct profile the abraxas provides. Absolutely unique and a legendary beer amongst the pastry scene. All hail the king.,5
84,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,2020 wasn’t as great as previous years and was a let down. I was looking forward to this one more than any other beer out of the societe du chene membership.,3.85
85,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,Another one I had for the first time in 2020. Typically I don't care for beer that has chile peppers infused but this one hits the nail on the hand. The perfect blend with cinnamon.,4.95
86,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,2019 Vintage (13% ABV) - Gold wax-dipped bottle - Poured into a stemless snifter at 48°F.,4.16

2020 vintage",4.33
88,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Insanely great stout! Lots of the expected goodies: Choco, coffee- but also the amazing cinnamon. Really good, and much more solid body than the none BA.",4.58
89,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Black in color with no penetration to light. The aroma is of cinnamon, chocolate fudge, vanilla, and whiskey. I’m tasting dark chocolate brownies, cinnamon, vanilla, and whiskey. The mouth is lusciously smooth and insanely drinkable for 13%.",4.51
90,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,2019 edition poured into a tulip glass via draft,4.51
91,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Had on draft from a snifter at Perennial.
L: Dark, not totally black, but close, with a thin brown head.
S: Choc-o-lot
T: Very chocolate as well, cinnamon rounded out at the end. I didn't get a ton of heat when cold, but the second half of my pour it comes out nicely at the back end and really augments the rest of the bear. The whiskey is apparent throughout as well, but not as some of their other barrel aged beers.
F: Viscous and in a way that works well with the beer.
O: This was like drinking two different beers warm and cold, which was awesome. A nearly perfectly balanced beer and this coming from someone who usually doesn't like cinnamon in his stouts.",4.74
92,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"On tap at Hops & Pie(10/2017). Black appearance with a small tan colored head. Pleasant aroma of light chili peppers, chocolate malt, vanilla, cinnamon, light oak and a touch of whiskey barrel. Similar flavor, rich, malty and moderately sweet with a lightly spiced bitterness. Medium to full body with soft carbonation, a smooth feel and a balanced finish. An excellent sipper overall.",4.74
93,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"The beer pours Pitch Black with a medium dark brown head that recedes quickly. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of cinnamon, nutmeg, Chillies, and earthy chocolate. It tastes of cinnamon, nutmeg, mild spice from the Chillies, earthy chocolate, and light barrel. The feel is medium and well balanced. A great barrel aged stout, but not really blowing me away.",4.52
94,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Obsidian black, with burnt motor oil brown edges at a closer look, and very minimal visible carbonation, but for a thin dark mocha ring that dies to a silky surface fairly quickly.",4.22
95,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a small, creamy head. Smell is dominated by rich chocolate fudge and an intense cinnamon note, as well as a strong earthy, oaky, peppery rye barrel note and hints of vanilla and chili. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by chocolate fudge, cinnamon and and a subtle but complex rye barrel character of earthy, musty, oaky, peppery notes, as well as lighter notes of roasted malt, vanilla, chili peppers and just a hint of dark fruits. Finishes with a light sweetness and some cinnamon and oaky, spicy notes lingering in the aftertaste. Full, creamy mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation.",4.3
96,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,Had side-by-side with KBBS and it won the night. Retains all the amazing notes of regular Abraxas with a perfect barrel character and mouth feel. Amazing beer!,4.9
97,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Completely by accident, I ran across this beer at a craft beer bar that I frequent - had never heard of Abraxas. Barrel aged imperial stout sounded like the kind of beer I like, so I got a small taste just to see if I wanted a full pour. Didn't take long to decide...in fact, I had a second pour because I couldn't imagine any of the other 99 or so taps could have anything this delicious.",5
98,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Lucky enough to get a tip of when this was tapping at this year's Great Taste of the Midwest. Otherwise I probably would have missed it. Because with so many beers to try, I find it hard to keep track of when specific beers are being tapped. But I am very grateful that I was near the Perennial tent around 2:00 when they started pouring what turned out to be one of the best beers I have ever had.",4.91
99,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,"Sample at Mikkeller Beer Celebration Copenhagen 2018, Green Session. Aroma has spicy notes like cinnamon and chili with whiskey and dark chocolate on top. Taste is spicy but well balanced with dark chocolate bitterness and light chili heat.",4.7
100,Heady Topper,"There's something magical about drinking a heady: from that delicious first sip to the absolute satisfaction of the last... the hype is real. After many years, I'm still in love with this beer because of its complex yet delicious presentation. Oh, and the smell could wake a sick person from a deathly slumber to delighted excitement.",5
101,Heady Topper,"Great brew, very tasty and loaded with a good variety of hops. Rare, which is why I was so grateful to acquire two 4packs. Not the best beer I have ever had - Personally I think focal banger is better. Focal Banger is in my top 5. Would buy focal banger again would not buy heady topper again.",4.29

103,Heady Topper,"Review 1600
The Alchemist
Heady Topper
Date: 09 June 2021
It has been on my wants for years; I only dreamed of the day I got this beer. Once my holy grail, now on to the next whale. I have drunk 1600 beers on BA and Reviewed 99%. As I look back since I began this journey, I am dumbfounded by how far I have come. My palate continues to improve; with every sip of beer, my beer knowledge grows, and my appreciation for the craft multiplies exponentially. The beer is 44 degrees, and I used my Jester King glass. The pour created a massive three-fingered bright white head with excellent retention. The foamy and soapy head dissipated slowly, tatting lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 5, pale straw with light golden hues. The clarity of the beer is somewhat hazy, with yeast floating in the liquid. The beer is sublime.",4.99
104,Heady Topper,"I live in VT and buy a pack of these every couple months. Most recent was canned ten days before consumption, yesterday and tonight.",4.96
105,Heady Topper,"I know I'm supposed to drink it from the can... buuuut it pours a semi clear yellow orange color with a medium bodied white colored head that fades quickly but laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of sweet roasted malts, a mix of earthy, floral, and citrus hops finish up the nose. Tastes of sweet roasted malts and then finishes of a nice mix of floral, earthy, and citrusy hops. It's somewhere in between the IPAs of yesterday and the NEIPA craze of today. It's crisp yet smooth, perfect amount of carbonation. Excellent beer.",4.74
106,Heady Topper,"Pint can of Heady-Topper dated 06/05/21. Served in a can glass, because I want to. Pours slightly hazy and with a nice white head, though not quite as cloudy or murky as Focal Banger. Aroma is not the most potent, but it has a more traditional pine hop profile than I expected. Inhaling deeply I do get a bit of sweet juice. Flavor is big on those tropical juicy flavors. Guava, mango, grapefruit zest. Where Focal Banger has considerable IBUs and conventional alpha bitterness, Heady Topper has the strength and even a hint of the 8% ABV is actually present on the palate. But this is really only a comparative defect; compared to millions of other IPAs the alcohol is still very well hidden.",4.02
107,Heady Topper,"Appearance: Clear, light amber (unfiltered) with fluffy white head with good retention",4.65
108,Heady Topper,Other breweries that arent focusing on making pine the central-flavor of their IPAs aren’t doing it right.,4.97
109,Heady Topper,"I finally had a chance to try this East Coast IPA and compare it to the West Coast Pliny The Elder, as it is now being sold in the San Francisco Bay Area.",4.19
110,Heady Topper,"Finally had a chance to taste this. I wasn't disappointed, just a great beer. It had a bit more bitterness than I was expecting. Would love to have it fresh from the brewery to see if my thoughts would change.",4.15
111,Heady Topper,Pours only slightly hazy with a good carbonation. The overall taste is smooth and slightly sweet. it has a slight lean toward orange and mango with good mouthfeel. It defies the 8%.,4.77
112,Heady Topper,"Genuinely one of the best beers in the world. I have no idea how they managed to say the beer has ""waves and waves of hop flavor"" and then actually accomplish that. There is without a doubt sorcery involved here but I'll take it. It is worth selling your soul for on at least six days of the week.",4.89
113,Heady Topper,"Canned 6/21/21/Poured on 7/2/21...Sweet, tropical hoppy, slightly malty, and sweet piney-dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a malty-sweet, and prominent piney-hoppy bitter finish...some mild nuttiness shows up on the backend as it warms. This is an old-school, tasty brew...and I am glad I finally got to try this!",4.15
114,Heady Topper,"This one is a throwback to the good old days of pine flavored IPA's. Pine and resin are the main aromas followed by citrus, and tropical hops in the foreground. Candy malt backbone to support the beer. Slight astringency. Strong bitterness that last for a while. Despite it's strength and bitterness I still find it very drinkable and the malts do a good job of supporting the more powerful flavors. Very good.",4.59
115,Heady Topper,"OG of IPAs…. By today’s standards don’t think I’m giving it 100, but definitely need to have at least once in your life! Not the palate review ya’ll we’re expecting",4.13
116,Heady Topper,Drank from a 16 oz can dated 5/21/21. Golden opaque yellow with decent initial foam - poured partially into a glass to observe color. Very pleasant albeit strong and thick - good feel. Not sure I can really add to what's already been posted. Worthy of the hype.,4.4
117,Heady Topper,"Pours a clear golden color with a big fluffy white head which lingers for a while. There’s some sediment which drops to the bottom. Big tropical fruit especially pineapple, apple with pine, grass and hops on the nose. Taste is outstanding...well balanced sweetness on the front of tropical fruit with some dankness which turns to a dense hopslam of bitterness which isn’t overpowering but lingers. As advertised! Brilliant brew!",4.72
118,Heady Topper,"Purchased as a 4 pk from a chilled case. Consumed about 1 month after brew date. Nice gold color with moderate haze/no floaties, beautiful white voluminous head that lasts a awhile and leaves some nice lacing. Smell was more muted than I expected given the advertised emphasis on the hops, but the flavor was very nice and complex with no single flavor dominating. This is like a whole bunch of ingredients mashed up together, but in a good way so that nothing slaps you in the face as a single ingredient carrying most of the load. Yes, I did drink some from the can but no big difference from the flavor in the glass, and this one looks so nice it is a shame not to take in the visual pleasure. Overall really nice but the cost ($18/4pk) is off-putting since other darned good IPAs can be had for significantly less.",4.71
119,Heady Topper,"A; I was a bad boy and poured a touch into a glass to see what I was drinking. Pours a beautiful golden hazy orange/yellow, small amount of white head dissipating quickly.",4.64
120,Heady Topper,"Worth the hype. Pretty much everything that can be said has been: great, complex flavor, with an especially outstanding dry hop finish. Really an excellent, excellent brew. Note: I gave the look a 5 even though I couldn’t see it, since I drank it from a can like a proper citizen.",5
121,Heady Topper,"This was exciting to a try, and I definitely recommend doing so if you have the opportunity, I feel like I wasn't necessarily mind blown as I've had a few NE style IPA's now but this was definitely really solid.",4.28
122,Heady Topper,"Okay, got this the first time from a BIF and @JayORear and while I thoroughly enjoyed that, I didn't have the experience to rate it. So while in Colorado last week visiting family, imagine my surprise to see this on the shelves. I live in Michigan and we never see this!
In any case, I had to try it again, and so glad I did. This is the real deal - no froo froo additives or quadruple dry hopped monster, just sheer goodness in the way of The Alchemist and their double IPA. The look is raw honey, and the aroma a clearly Citra led hop parade. Very pleasant. The taste though, excellence in the NE IPA genre - just outstanding in flavor and feel. Apparently one is meant to drink this from the can and going forward I will, but for this round I wanted to see what I was drinking.
Anyway, the more beers I am exposed to, the more I appreciate the basics, the ones that strive to be the best in category by pure skill and ingredients, not the latest hop or adjunct. This would be a regular in my beer fridge if it were available in Michigan.",4.75
123,Heady Topper,"This beer has always been one that I have admired from afar. I remember when I first joined this site over a decade ago, this beer was #1. Out of the blue, we got a shipment in CO. No idea if this is a one-off shipment or not, but I was elated to find this one hanging on at my local store. Bought at Hazel's in Boulder, CO on 05/13/21. 4 pack of 16 oz cans for $18.49 before tax. Canned 05/08/21, consumed 05/16/21.",4.69

125,Pliny The Younger,"The other reviewers pretty much hit everything I have to say about this beer, except that you will get very, very drunk if you have more than three or four ;). *This is a biased review. I'm from the area and went to SRJC. No matter, this is one of the best beers you can buy in the world.",4.54
126,Pliny The Younger,"From bottle. This pours a beautiful amber-yellow in appearance with good bit of foam upon aggressive pour. Citrusy aromas burst which make their way into the initial flavor profile before the familiar onslaught of piney and bitter notes come in for the end. It's a top tier West Coast DIPA.... and it drinks like it, in spite of higher than expected abv. It does not come across as strong or boozy. It somehow maintains a 'smoother than expected' feel. It's a fantastic beer, and I look forward to trying this on draft one day.",4.54
127,Pliny The Younger,"500ml bottle sent to me by a friend that works at RR. Poured out a clear, golden amber color with a good-sized, rocky head of foam. It smelled dank, fruity, piney with a caramel sweetness. Orange and grapefruit taste with a sharp piney bitterness. Rich caramel and toffee backbone.",4.87

130,Pliny The Younger,Bottled on 2/3/21; consumed on 3/3/21,4.47
131,Pliny The Younger,"The beer comes in a light to medium gold color with a light chill haze, medium head with great lacing and medium minus sustain.",4.49
132,Pliny The Younger,Haven't had this one in over a year but always worth checking in a classic like this! Worth the hours-long wait in the rain just for the experience alone. Even got a sweet Pliny the Younger poncho to boot!,4.32
133,Pliny The Younger,"The best beer I have tasted. Amazing balance, hides alcohol so well! So much, 10 times better than Pliny the Elder (which in my view is over hyped).
Pliny the Younger = Best balanced Triple IPA. Best Beer. No words.",4.93
134,Pliny The Younger,"I'm not the biggest fan of IPAs, but living near-ish to the Russian River brewery and experiencing the hype every year, I just had to go to their location in Windsor with a couple friends to try this back in February (gotta love pre-pandemic times). Got it on-tap while there, as well as in bottled form for later. Color was slightly cloudy but mostly clear, and it poured a very small head.",4.25
135,Pliny The Younger,"This is one of the sickest IPAs out there! As if Elder is not good enough, this one takes an even cleaner, smoother approach than the mentioned one. Absolutely delicious!",5
136,Pliny The Younger,"Just realized I didn't check this one in on 2/19, reviewed from notes.
Just an overall excellent expression of West coast hops, piney, citrus, super clean and smooth. Worthy of the hype.",4.5
137,Pliny The Younger,"L: Slight opaque honey yellow haze with minimal head
S: Light delecate pine scent, no pungent alcohol smell for a triple IPA.
T&F: Very delicate dissolving starfruit and pine taste with slightly slick mouth feel and a clean finish. Where is the booziness? Is this juice?
O: Its hard not to have hundreds of questions of how they made such a world class beer, but one must accept it and enjoy the moment. This is the legend! Its a privilege to have the opportunity to taste it. Its worth all the hype and more!",4.84
138,Pliny The Younger,Excellent annual brew from RRBC. Has a clear fresh look and hoppy aroma with a surprisingly smooth and light taste for a Triple IPA. Stood in line for 4.5 hours with my wife at the downtown brewery on Valentine Day and then for 1.5 hours the next day with some friends. It was definitely worth it each time. Recommend making the trip to the brewery for some “Younger“ if you’re an IPA fan.,4.92
139,Pliny The Younger,"After 8 years of hunting this beer, I finally got to experience it via bottle! Thank you RR for bottling this for us east coasters!",4.6
140,Pliny The Younger,10 oz pour from a keg at Monk's Cafe during Pliny Week.,4.85
141,Pliny The Younger,"Finally got to try this whale. It was very good, however the hype around this beer killed it. I have tried many IPA'S that I consider better than Pliny the Younger. I would never again pay the premium for this beer. One and done.",4.31
142,Pliny The Younger,500ml bottle into a tulip. Huge thanks to my friend Scott for hooking me up with this long-time dream beer!,4.7
143,Pliny The Younger,"Def lived up to the Hype, exactly as I expected. Super smooth n drinkable. Lottsa flavor and extremely well balanced. Was worth the effort to get. I hope they bottle it every year.",4.79
144,Pliny The Younger,"L: Orange. Opaque but not hazy. Less than a finger white head
S: Pine, some citrus. Hop resin
T: Huge hit of pine up front. There is some citrus. This does hide the ABV well. Finishes smooth and dry
F: Good carb level with a light to medium body
O: This is a great west coast IPA. It is very similar to the Elder but it does finish a little smoother with slightly more citrus.",4.27
145,Pliny The Younger,"Never wrote my review for this. Got a chance to sample on Monday, March 2nd following a Pliny event locally. Enjoyed it so much I ordered another, and had a third the next day.
Not sure what to add after all that has been said but I'm definitely on the side of those who've raved about this. I thought The Elder was my favorite IPA, then I had The Younger. A gorgeous golden color, with the most pleasant, honey and citrus tinged aroma. The taste was something else: an incredible collection of honey, piney, citrusy and hoppiness all rolled into one incredible brew. Fantastic aftertaste, and I must add I didn't notice the alcohol until after I consumed my second.
Already looking forward to next year's offering. Just hoping they decide to expand the bottlings to include Southern California as well.",5
146,Pliny The Younger,First year it has been bottled and my first time getting it. Bottle date 2-14-2020 poured into a tulip glass.,4.92
147,Pliny The Younger,"Stoked to finally get to try this one. My best friend Jon Passow has some friends in California who sent him a bottle of this that he is kind enough to share with me. Poured into a tulip glass, this beer pours a mainly clear, just slightly cloudy/hazy, light to medium golden color with a nice white head that's about an inch thick when first poured. Settles to a thick ring lining the inside of the glass at the beer's surface and there's also a thick cluster swirl of foam in the middle of the beer's surface and good, but not phenomenal, lacing. Aromas of some crisp, slightly zesty malts along with melon, citrus, floral, earthy, dank hops. Quite the bouquet of different hop aromas here. The flavor is pretty much on point to the aroma, with some somewhat bready, slightly zesty malts that are followed by all the aforementioned hop flavors cascading over my palate. Fruity hop notes of melon, grapefruit and oranges, a hint apricot, piney, and earthy hop notes with a hint of spice, and some floral hops as well that give nice hop bitterness. This is nicely, aggressively hopped and fairly bitter, but not overbearingly so. The hops really do dominate though, and come out more as the beer sits and warms up a bit. Such an excellent, very complex hop flavor profile. Has a fairly crisp, also smooth, slightly oily and resinous,medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish and all the aforementioned hop flavors linger on my palate for a long time after each sip. A fantastic beer all around!",4.65
148,Pliny The Younger,"Had on tap. How exciting, both the older and younger on the same trip to CA! Oh yeah! Orangey yellow active pour, plenty of lacing, two fingers of foam. Piney hops, hop resin, lemon, grapefruit, white grape, honey, flowers, and orange zest aromas bouquet. Taste still holds up over all these years: zesty citrus, floral and piney hops, honey, white peach, mandarin orange and a kiss of white grape. Feel is hoppy, resinous, bright, surprisingly carbonated and has a sense of booziness behind it though not tasted or smelled. Nice balance and gasp, nuance, to a big triple ipa.",4.59
149,Pliny The Younger,"Poured from a bottle- not quite clear golden honey color with white head leaving bubbly lacing. Nose is piney with sweet floral notes,aroma is obvious as soon as bottles were opened. Taste follows with a fine hop balance and a moderate bitterness. Finish is very smooth -this is a fine brew that disguises the abv with flavor.",4.83
150,Mornin' Delight,5oz pour at Carmine Street in NYC.,4.98
151,Mornin' Delight,"Pure black pour with a huge maple nose. Lots of maple flavor balanced with coffee. Thick, velvety mouthfeel that leaves syrup stickiness. Just a great beer!!",4.99
152,Mornin' Delight,"Had a fresh ten ounce pour on tap into a tulip glass. The rich and luscious cocoa-colored foam pours two fingers deep over a nearly black base, and slowly dissolves leaving ample lacing coating the surface and the rim of the glass. Powerfully aromatic maple and coffee is detectable a foot away. Bringing the nose in closer reveals underlying notes of chocolate and an intense maple and coffee that is simply about as pleasing as can be expected from a beer. The taste is fresh maple and coffee, chocolate, molasses and syrup with just a hint of roasted malts and hops from the base beer. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall just short of life changing, but if every coffee stout were this good it would be a better world.",4.72
153,Mornin' Delight,"P: deep brownish black with a slight brown head which dissipates, stayed a bit stronger in the draft Bergson",4.77
154,Mornin' Delight,"Nose is of course clearly maple, all bait the beer itself is highly coffee dominated/driven. (To a somewhat surprising level I must say). A superb stout.",4.88
155,Mornin' Delight,"Look - black thick with a great tan foam and lacing
Smell - coffee maple maybe some blueberry
Taste - maple coffee chocolate vanilla, not overly sweet
Feel - full creamy body
Overall - really tasty",4.54
156,Mornin' Delight,"Maybe its the psychology of how hard this is to come by or how expensive it is but I loved this one! The only points I took off were for how sticky it leaves everything and for lack of a head. The taste is fantastic ... none of the bitterness of a typical beer of its kind, all of the flavour.",4.86
157,Mornin' Delight,"Maple nose, maple and roasty coffee combo throughout, and a long, lingering finish with a bit of heat. The maple does not overpower and fits in nicely with the coffee and roasty stout base.",4.54
158,Mornin' Delight,"Black like cannon fodder and aroma of maple and caramel. A very pleasant beer but far from the $50 price tag. A fantastic beer that should be a flagship for the brewery and not a large event once a year release— specially since other special releases TG does are predominantly barrel aged. Good beer, overpriced",4.08
159,Mornin' Delight,"Bottle @ 10K + OT. Thanks, Gil! Black in color without any head. Viscous. Maple syrup, coffee, vanilla, and graham cracker on the nose. Toffee, a hint of peanut brittle, and plenty of chocolate. Nice bitter chocolate on the taste to balance out the sweet toffee, vanilla, and maple. Nice graham cracker, roast, and coffee, too. Well done all around. Another solid beer from Toppling Goliath.",4.21
160,Mornin' Delight,Bellview! Straight crazy... Nose is a decadent blend of coffee and chocolate and that mouth feel that coats the tongue and back of yer throat leaving you needing another sip!,4.81

It is an outstanding beer and love to drink it when ever i can get it.",4.63

164,Mornin' Delight,"On tap at Whiskey Road in Cedar Falls, IA. Six-ounce pour, served in a small snifter. Deep, almost lightproof brownish-black in color, with a thin ring of tan foam. (The beer was apparently drawn to minimize the amount of foam, which for the price was okay by me.) Big and bold aromas and flavors of coffee, maple, toffee, chocolate, and molasses. No char. Lots of sweetness and alcohol warmth as expected, but incredibly smooth. Mouthfeel is delightfully thick and syrupy. The maple syrupy sweetness and notes of espresso linger on the finish. Does it live up to the hype? You betcha!",5

171,Mornin' Delight,"To start I would like to say this was purchased on tap at a local bottle shop doing pours and crowlers. I may change this after I open the crowler, but this review is based solely off the 10 oz. pour I had at the release. With that being said it was quite cold off the initial pour.",4.92
172,Mornin' Delight,"Wow, I was expected to be let down on this but it exceeded my expectations. You get the coffee & maple coming through with a thick mouthfeel and perfect sweetness, not overly sweet.",4.65
173,Mornin' Delight,"L -- Pours a thick, viscous black in the glass with just a scant off-brown head produced with moderately aerated pour. The guy filling my growler apologized to me because the beer is so thick that it takes quite a while to pour out of the tap
S -- HUGE maple presence. Kinda hard to decide whether its a nice stack-of-pancakes type of maple character or straight up artificial Aunt Jemima. Hmmm... Also getting coffee ice cream, salted caramel, hazelnut, milk chocolate, and a hint of booze
T -- Largely follows the nose with the hefty adjunct profile. In order of intensity of flavors, I'm getting maple, coffee syrup, milk chocolate, vanilla, hazelnut. The base stout itself seems fairly unremarkable. No perceivable booze, which is pretty cool for the ABV
F -- Big mouthfeel, minimal carb. Not as crazy thick or velvety as expected. If anything it feels a bit on the thin side
O -- Row 34 once again pulling the rabbit out of the hat with these to-go growlers. At $42/32oz, it was very expensive but ironically was also far cheaper than buying bottles from the brewery (this year's release was $85/44oz split across two bottles). If you took the maple out, I would have difficulty distinguishing this from, say, Trillium's Night & Day or other (well made) sweet imperial coffee stouts. That being said, this seems to be targeted towards the folks who don't really mind artificial flavors, etc. As someone who likes coffee as much as beer, the fact that TG insinuates in their description that people drink ""low-fat vanilla cream lattes"" in the first place is a pretty huge red flag. How about brewing something for the single-source pour-over crowd",4.19

Juicy yet soft creamy feel; medium body; no astringency; no warmth from 8.2% abv; light carbonation.

188,King Julius,"Pours a darkish, hazy yellow/orange. Great head and lacing. The aroma is overripe mango and orange with peach and a light candied malt character. The flavor follows suit with a smooth bitterness, juicy tropical fruits, overripe citrus and some sweet cereal grains. The mouthfeel is lush and velvety, and the beer finishes cleanly on the tongue. Overall, this reminds me a lot of very hazy with the overripe fruit character. Very little dankness, and huge juiciness. World class for sure.",4.61

195,King Julius,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Opaque yellow/light orange color; almost like orange juice in the glass. Big, pillowy head on the pour with a thin rim that lingers and leaves great lacing. Smell is a blend of tropical and citrus fruits, but also dank and floral. Remarkably smooth and well balanced; juicy and chewy. The tropical and citrus fruit flavors are there with a slight sweetness, as is a floral hop bitterness that sticks around on the finish. Goes down easy for an 8.3% DIPA. Would seek this out again.",4.52
196,King Julius,"Pours a hazy straw color with a finger of head. The nose has bold notes of citrus (especially lemons) and dankness, as well. The flavor is juicy with a hop bite that is more potent than most offerings from this brewery.",4.29

Feel is fantastic, light but creamy and full bodied, crisp finish, not overly dry. One of the best hazy IPAs I've had, but I'd probably still give the nod to King JJJuliusss.",4.5

202,King JJJuliusss,"Pours a very hazy, approaching turbid, orange color with a dense, creamy white head that laces the glass beautifully. Truly looks like orange juice in my glass. The nose is rife with juicy, tropical citrus notes, with orange sherbet most prominent, along with pity grapefruit, and mango.",4.6

205,King JJJuliusss,"Pours a hazy orange color with a thick white colored head with tons of lacing down the glass. The head stays as a small layer over the beer for most of the way down. Smells like a treehouse, it's extremely aromatic with hints of orange, grapefruit, and even a bit of sugar at the end of it. Tastes of juicy grapefruit mostly with a hint of a sweet melon about halfway through. Finishes tart, not exactly as smooth as I was hoping for coming from the famed Julius line but overall pretty good. Thick mouthfeel with a bit of warming from the high abv.",4.34
206,King JJJuliusss,"16oz can at share. Hazy orange pour with white foamy head. Mostly citrusy aroma, notes of tropical fruit too. Taste is fruity and full, super juicy, sweet. Top notch. I can see why the scores are so high.",4.36
207,King JJJuliusss,Creamy honey mango and pineapple with a background of orange. Medium mouthfeel and carb. Straight up the mango hichew if there was pineapple and orange in it in liquid form. There is a balanced bitterness with that hichew like sweetness.,4.92
208,King JJJuliusss,"I don’t know why but I’m partial to the std Julius; this king version is fantastic and an awesome treat, but maybe just a tad overworked on my palate. Yes it is hopped but the citrus tropical notes come through clear.",4.84
209,King JJJuliusss,"...because what really IS a 5 in an IPA 'Look' ??? but we all know the reputation. if i had any 'bucket list' beers left, this would be one of them... and here i am! but it's just another very-well done Treehouse brew... not as rich as someof the other 'standards' but very very good.... it deserves the rating i gave",4.71
210,King JJJuliusss,"Canned 2/8. Absolutely amazing. Cloudy orange, fluffy minimal head and lacing. Tropical citrus notes of orange, pineapple, mango, and grapefruit on the aroma that carry over to the taste. However, there’s very little of the dank or bitterness I’ve come to find in their NEIPAs. This one is juice all the way home. Mouth watering, medium bodied, and I’m going to have to try to find a way not to drink it too quickly to see if it fills out as it warms. Just outstanding, and more than lives up to the hype.",4.99

212,King JJJuliusss,Tasted it up against King Julius and Jjjuliusss. Liked King Julius just a hair better but all incredible. Huge citrus and I get some tropical fruits. Orange and grapefruit up front with a finish of pineapple and some papaya. Definitely crushable. Wow.,5

Look: orange juice. Creamy fluffy head.
Smell: orange sherbet, ripe papaya.
Taste: papayas, mango, orange sherbet. No alcohol presence. Minimal resiny bitterness.
Feel: perfectly juicy, but not so much it is filling or thick.
Overall: very impressive. This is the kind of neipa I am generally critical of. Too sweet, not bitter enough. This is perfect despite lack of bitterness. Treehouse is just masters of this style IMO.",4.6
215,King JJJuliusss,"This is a beaut of a double IPA, don't get me wrong. The thing is...I expected more based on how this brew has been extolled to me by people I trust and reviews here and elsewhere. It's a gorgeous looking thing to behold in the glass that's for sure. Banging juicy citrus and tropical nose up front with hints of ripe peach, crushed mango and wafts of piney resin. It's the palate to me that's just okay. I feel like this brew it tight. It doesn't open up like say King JJJULIUSS or Very Hazy. The juiciness is subdued and while I get the pine, the stone, citrus and tropical fruit notes in there, it's just restrained. Big full mouth feel is exceptional as are most of TH efforts.",4.42
216,King JJJuliusss,A: Pours a hazy golden orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a nice cap that leaves good lacing,4.82
217,King JJJuliusss,"Yeah, well worth the wait. All the hype surrounding this beer was well deserved. Color is glowingly orange, and I was stuck between wanting to savor and chug!",4.98
218,King JJJuliusss,"Pours a fully turbid, almost glowing deep apricot orange, sitting like apricot purée in the glass. A finger of creamy white head sits atop, receding to a full collar.",4.48
219,King JJJuliusss,"So, finally trying this one was an achievement... did it live up to the hype? Oh yes, absolutely! Insanely great balanced, with hops, fruityness as well as a solid body. Extremely well balanced. Delicious!",4.94
220,King JJJuliusss,"Canned 10/1/20, tasted 10/28/20. A super-hyped beer that was certainly delicious, but didn't quite reach the pinnacle I was expecting. The look was not super-appetizing because it had a muddled orange/brown color - I found the brighter look of King Julius or Jjjuliusss to be much more appealing. The smell was excellent, though - very rich and enticing. The taste was very good but not incredible - it had a slight sourness to it that I wasn't a huge fan of. It definitely has a touch more bitterness and grassy hop character than KJ or Jjjsss, which may appeal to some palates, but in my view it detracted from what made those other beers stand out. The feel was good but not as fluffy or creamy as some other TH DIPAs.",4.55
221,King JJJuliusss,"Very well done beer, aroma and taste are a big leap from KIng Julius, however not enough for the price of admission. It would be better to get a six pack of regular jjjulius over this one and be just as enjoyable, 6 times over.",4.53

Small pour in a small glass.
Dark as can be.
Thick, it was making big legs in the glass.
Smell was BAM!! Deep chocolate and coffee!
The taste...oh my gosh, it was so strong I had to share it with my family it was amazing!!! A 5 oz pour was $18!! But so worth it! Epic good! Not sweet like Mornin Delight but still that powerful stout flavor, wow! This is top notch!!!",4.78

230,SR-71,"I don't know what was up with this, but I didn't find this beer very good at all. It was slightly tart on the finish, which made me think it was going bad in some form. I didn't get much barrel character, thinner mouthfeel and compared to all the other stouts we were enjoying, probably the worst of the night which is crazy. Likely just a bad bottle, but didn't know those existed with this beer. Unfortunate, but rating is as accurate as I can be with it.",2.61
231,SR-71,"What an amazing nose that lingers well after I've stopped smelling; supremely luscious body, with the flavors lingering for a while too; the finish is boozy yet controlled, balanced, and well executed.",4.74

233,SR-71,"This beer takes everything that is lovely about purple wax Assassin and amplifies it into a sludgy, brownie-batter-dipped-in-whiskey beer. Overall, the flavor profile is akin to Assassin, with bursts of fudge and dark chocolate on the palate, followed by waves of raisiny, dark fruit flavor. The barrel presence is more pronounced, with a woodier, more bourbon-forward profile, but it never delves into the trenches of the dreaded cicerone descriptor of, ""too hot."" The mouthfeel on this beer is virtually unrivaled by any other in the game.",4.88
234,SR-71,"Pours thick and black, with a thin dark brown head that fades to a dark brown ring around the glass. The aroma is chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. The taste is chocolate, marshmallow, vanilla, lots of barrel, but not boozy. There also seems to be some smokiness on the finish. It's a little on the sweet side, but not overly sweet. The mouthfeel is thick. Overall, this beer is a work of art. Like KBBS, I was worried that it was over-hyped, but, also like KBBS, that is not the case. This beer is as close to perfect as a barrel-aged stout can be.",4.9

Aftertaste is of honey and coats your tongue. Certainly sweet but great flavors where the barrel cuts the sweetness of the base stouts. Had side by side with Assassin 14 one time; Killed it. and way better then 2018 SR. I think this beer was a happy accident that they will never recreate.",4.97

It looks perfects, smells nice, nice mouthfeel, and tastes delicious. It may be the bar for a barrel-aged stout. Perfection. Its hard to describe. I'm not wowed, but at the same time its subtle, rounded, and wonderful. I'm going to side by side w 2016 BCBS in a minute.
...back. My hunch was BCBS was a similar beer from memory. Its not. SR-71 crushes it.",4.73
243,SR-71,"Side by side at a killer whalez share, this was incredible.... can't rank anything equal to Bake Kujira but this is definitely in the top beers I've ever had. Huuuuuuuge body - thicker than any body with no adjuncts that I've ever come across, barrel so well integrated into the chocolate-forward base. It's the best non-adjunct stout you will ever come across and was a completely different monster from that of a fresh 2016 Assassin, we had right before this one.",5
244,SR-71,"Had this at the Tasting to Sink all Sea Shepherds, at Moeder Lambic cellar, side by side with KBBS '14, MD #2 and yellow wax Assassin
A: Looks exactly like Assassin, pitch black, very thick and sticky, with a decent retention.
S: Smell is very similar to Assassin, focused on vanilla and chocolate, with notes of marzipan and dried fruits. At the beginning, I had a hard time differenciating both beers, but as it warmed, it became a little bit boozier, the barrel ageing emphasizing the alcohol content.
T: Taste is also very similar, on vanilla, marzipan, chocolate and fudge, but a little less mellowed and with more alcohol and more bitterness on the finish. Also very sweet.
M: Thick, almost syrupy. A little bit smoother on the palate than Assassin, but the alcohol kick makes it a little bit less enjoyable than Assassin.
O: Very similar to Assassin but a little bit less well integrated which prevents this to being great. Probably my least favorite of the TG stouts, still a very good brew.",4.49
245,SR-71,Very similar to Assassin but somehow better. So does this make this beer a 5+? Might need to adjust your rating scale BA to make Ron for a beer this good. Best nonmaple BA bet I have ever had.,5

248,SR-71,"I normally don't rate anything all 5s, but this is hands down the best BA Imperial Stout that I've ever had, adjuncts or no, and side by side with KBBS it blew it out of the water. This beer is phenomenal.",5

T - Taste matches the smell, getting lots of oranges and grapefruit.
F - Medium body and carbonation with a creamy feel.
O - This is an outstanding New England IPA. I wish I had more.",4.59

Very Hazy
TreeHouse Brewing
Date: 02June 2021
My continued pursuit for all things Treehouse, this my Fifthteenth beer. I received this from a recent BIF, and it is fresh. I served it about 44 degrees using a generic tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a massive two-fingered head. Citrus emit as the beer is poured. The creamy and foamy white head dissipated slowly, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color of the beer charts around SRM 6, pale straw with golden yellow hues. This beer is hazy and beautiful.",4.75
255,Very Hazy,"Large three finger head, irregular surface, just off shite hue, average retention, thin if extended lacing. Looks the part, apricot juice in a glass. Keen edged dankness to the nose, at times close to pencil lead, strong biscuit component as well, rich peach, apricot, melon to kiwi fruit scents, topped off by pink grapefruit and mint. Full-bodied, lush mouth feel, only starts to turn dry by the finish. Carbonation soft and fluffy, no match for the sugary sweetness of the fruit and citrus. Black tea leaf and cigar wrapper more than marijuana for dankness. Piney here as the melon comes to the fore. No getting much by way of florality. Fleshy and fun, does show some alcohol if allowed to warm. While very good doesn't break away from the pack. (Canned 8/5/21)",4.31
256,Very Hazy,"Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass canned on 7/20/21. Pours a very hazy orange yellow, with a finger plus sticky white head that leaves thick streaks of lace with excellent retention. 4.75",4.33

261,Very Hazy,"Pours like it says, very hazy, with a light orange/yellow color that you can't see through at all. Light white head that fades quickly and leaves a little lacing down the glass. Smells of citrus and melon and some sweetness at the end. Taste is equally pleasing with big grapefruit, orange notes up front and finishes with a melon and a bit grassy (lawn) at the end. Smooth, perfect amount of carbonation, well done.",4.4
262,Very Hazy,"Looks and smells nice, but I find the taste, eh, lacking something. Seems like the odd carbonation/mouthfeel is hiding the hop character this beer wants to have.",3.88
263,Very Hazy,Growler from the source. Cloudy opaque yellow/orange pour with a big white head. Big tropical fruit bouquet. The tropical fruits smash you in face right out of the gate then give way to bitter piney/resiny hop notes. Plenty of caramel malt backbeats to keep the balance in check. Peach and apricot undercurrents. Really good mouthfeel and body. This is delicious and dangerous at 8.6%....,4.35
264,Very Hazy,Great compliment to the standard Haze offering. Showcases an impressive amount of hops and sass (you'll forget it's 8.6%). Has the signature Tree House mouth feel. Definitely worth tracking this one down.,4.99
265,Very Hazy,"Pours a hazy golden with a thick, creamy white head and has good lacing. The aroma is very peachy and orangey with a subtle spice. The malt aroma is bready with a honey-like quality. As for the taste, it is very juicy, overripe peach, sweet citrus, and tropical fruit with a very smooth bitterness. The malt does a nice job in a supporting role with round, warm bready flavors and some sweetness. The beer has a very lush, creamy body, a nice prickly carbonation, and a moderately dry finish. Overall, this is a truly stellar NEIPA. Huge juicy flavor and aroma, creamy dreamy body, and a very restrained bitterness. Tree House is really one of the best in the business.",4.58

267,Very Hazy,"Canned 4 days ago and tried blind alongside a 10-day-old can of Haze. Both my friend and I were shocked to discover that we both slightly preferred regular Haze, and actually both guessed that it was the Very Hazy -- the aromas were almost identical, and the flavors were juicier on the Haze and more bitter on the Very Hazy. Same fluffy mouthfeel in both. Both are stellar beers, but regular Haze wins both in terms of drinkability and availability",4.45
268,Very Hazy,"Was lucky enough to obtain this via a trade recently as this was one of the few popular offerings from Tree House that I had never reviewed on here before. Love the Haze and this was on par with it, although I thought it was a bit overrated. Needless to say, that's only because of the insanely high standards that this brewery has set as it wasn't because this was a letdown in any way, shape, or form!",4.35
269,Very Hazy,"Can @ Monkish. As with Haze, a milky orange beer with white foam. This one isn’t quite as enjoyable as regular Haze, in my opinion. It’s a little more sweet and caramel forward and also has a more pronounced resinous and pithy bitterness. Still has some nice peach, grapefruit, orange, and dried pineapple hop character, though. It’s fine enough, but not great.",3.58

274,Very Hazy,"Sweet orange citrus, sweet bready-malty, and tropical hoppy dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a malt forward, tropical hoppy and hint of grapefruit citrus bitter swallow. The heavy malt presence upfront interferes a bit with enjoying the hoppy finish...makes the backend a little muddled and disjointed. What helps make up for that is that it is oh so soft on the palate! This still good and enjoyable, just didn't reach those sky high expectations I was anticipating.",4.39

Bottle. 10/08/2019. Ebony in colour with a thick dense, tan head. Continuous lacing is apparent.
Rich, sweet aroma of maple syrup, bourbon, lightly toasted wholemeal bread and chocolate.
Flavours intermingle. Vanilla appears with a touch of oak. Sweet at the front and medium bitter at the back.
Viscous and boozy feel.
Deserves the accolades.",4.53
277,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"My first taste of CBS was two years ago when I had one from that years bottling. I wasn't blown away, as the sweet maple flavor came across as too strong. Later, I tried a bottle that was over a year old, and then was blown away. So I decided to now give this one a true review. Bottled 10/9/2019, poured into a snifter. Great stout appearance, with inky black color and tan lacing that settles into a consistent ring around the glass. Smell is of mocha, coffee and maple, with light bourbon. A great blend of aromas. Lovely taste that balances all of the aroma components. The bourbon is just right in that doesnt dominate the other tastes. Mouthfeel is typical of a first rate stout. Im glad I gave CBS another try, as the extra aging in the bottle IMO represents, at least to my taste, the beer with a World Class rating",4.69
278,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Absolutely the best stout that I have ever had; bar none. You can taste and feel the alcohol content. It is not overwhelming, but smooth instead. Will buy again!",5
279,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),Outstanding! Had on tap. Loved it from beginning to end. Even more flavors came out as the beer warmed. This is definitely a winner! 11% abv completely hidden. Just a delicious maple treat that gets you a good buzz!,5
280,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Dark, rich, and delicious. Plenty sweet, but balanced and not over-the-top. All of the adjuncts come through with none overwhelming the others. I recently popped one of my last bottles (from 2019) and it is still holding up great.",4.53
281,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"sickly sweet. foul. this is for college kids from vermont who like to clammer on about maple syrup and hippie culture. the beer itself is so disgustingly sweet that you should get a blood test after drinking one to see if this swill gives you diabetes. seeing a 100 next to this garbage only proves the point that the majority of ""craft"" beer drinkers are buffoons with no more integrity than a top notch brown nose pole polisher. this is not beer.",2.02

283,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Wow, that is a tasty brew!
A very solid beer from a giant in the game.
Neglected vehicle motor oil esque color, tan head. Smell not overwhelming honestly. Might be due to low carbonation?
I would classify this as a ~tastefully~ flavored stout. Not some pastry flavored amalgamation marketed to hipsters. Not much chocolate, if anything, more of a “milk chocolate flavor, as opposed to the dark chocolate stout one is accustomed to. Kinda bizarre, as i don't think this beer has lactose. Little coffee. Maple becomes more present as i get deeper into the beer. Probably most prominent flavor. Very homemade chocolate pancake, with a lil edge. Hungover ihop and a cigarette?
Mouth feel is thick, but not so thick this beer is a chore to drink. Really no heat from the booze.
Overall, as I have “evolved” as a beer drinker, this style isn't something I crave, but rather have as a treat. The sweetness is a lil
much to drink these often, along with how much booze is in it. But for style, this beer is pretty excellent.",4.48
284,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"A somewhat classic from Founders, this big brother of KBS it’s a lot more. A LOT. And that tells you something ass KBS itself is also a good beer- still, it doesn’t come close to this: Lots of coffee, choco w/nice mouthfeel to it.",4.68

Impressive beer.",4.09

It pours a usual dark brown color and has a chocolaty brown head. The sweetness is apparent on the nose but belies the intense maple, chocolate, and coffee flavors that masks the 10% alcohol. I'm glad to have tried this, it's definitely one to share during the colder season.",4.55

293,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"DATE: February 1, 2021... OCCASION: having just posted my father's obituary while three feet of snow fall, I feel the night deserves something aged a few years... GLASSWARE: Lindemans stemmed tulip... pours a viscous jet black body that rolls out a a number of upward-cascading rivulets of effervescence... its head continues the show, stabilized as a thick half-finger's worth of light tan, creamy foam approximating a latte's froth... rich vanilla, maple syrup, mellow bourbon sweetness, a hint of smoke, some alcoholic heat... then heavy coffee bean and roasted malts arrive, and the profile is quite a celebration.... the first sip is frothy at the start, turning to velvet-smooth satin past the tongue and a warm entrancing finish that fires well after... the teeth pulse--the hops are in here--and the mouth holds its presence... the alcohol draws in and around, but like the best, it isn't tasted, but rather, appreciated... rich is the word--each sip is a dessert in itself, a settling, centering mood boost that makes one appreciate.... a massive collision of syrup and coffee initially arrest with intensity, before the sweet bourbon, charcoal smokiness, chocolate, and lactic acids round the experience into a drink worth mulling over... I especially like how they ignored the bacon temptation--this works so well featuring the original KBS with a worthwhile variation... it's a compliment this urges me to finish and pour a dram of the Jack Daniels Barrel Select I bought a while back, thought that introduces banana--eh, another story for another time... speaking of stories: I had a bomber waiting to be consumed on my forty-second birthday while staying with my in-laws in between houses, and my son unwittingly smashed it while opening the refrigerator...the dog loved it, but we all cried a bit. Fortunately, CBS returned not long after, and maybe it's better I drink it in 12oz. offerings... well, this was worth waiting for, and though it could be straight shot if only for its ABV, its sweetness makes each sip require a caesura before its next one...",4.65

Honestly, I never liked bourbon barrel beer before this. I now like them and I humbly believe that there are many beers as good and better than this one.
Don't get me wrong it was very good. I mean this is a world class beer, but I was missing the star trek transporter and the smell of charcoal lighter fluid in my hair. Maybe that is why I think there are better beers !",4.32

Smells of sweet vanilla, smells like cake with a hint of bourbon at the end. Taste is incredible, not as sweet as I was expecting. It's sweet vanilla upfront followed by bourbon and then a nice deep roasted malt flavor. It's smooth, perfect amount of carbonation, warming. Excellent beer, Bottle Logic does it again!",4.7
301,Fundamental Observation,"2018 bottle Poured cold, hard to a tulip. Jet black, no floaters. No head at all…starts to bubble for a ring, then peters out. Nose is a sort of light smoked cherry wood, not at all what I expected. First sips are great! The mix of bourbon barrels is very complex. You don’t get any one distinct flavor, but rather a changing swirl of sweetnesses and woods. The vanilla comes in mid-palate with a sort of vanilla bean shell earthiness, a hint of coffee-ness without the coffee. The malts are deep, robust, providing a massive foundation. Some of that cherry comes back toward the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect: Full but crisp and refreshing. Alcohol has that bourbon flavor, but no noticeable bite or warmth at this stage. As it warms, that might change. I can see why people search this out. Excellent brew!",5
302,Fundamental Observation,"2017 vintage courtesy of warmlager from Minnesota
Look: Black color fairly minimal brown/tan head. Minimum-moderate carbonation.
Smell: light bourbon, light vanilla, chocolate, wood.
Taste: vanilla, oak, chocolate, molasses, bourbon, maybe very slight oxidation.
Feel: medium-thin, smooth, very slight bourbon burn. “Booziness” well-hidden.
Overall: well incorporated vanilla stout with 3+ years on it. I heard the recent vintage was “not the same” so wanted to try one first that had a good reputation.
It is good? Yes. It is #13 beer in the world? No.
Solid 4.5.",4.49

308,Fundamental Observation,"I've had several different vintages over the years from 2015 to 2020 and it's varied quite a decent amount. Unfortunately, I feel as the years have progressed, it's a lost of the vanilla bomb characteristics and it's become boozier, more oaky and bourbon forward and carbonated in mouthfeel, with the most recent year having a cherry-like flavor.",4.33
309,Fundamental Observation,"On tap @ Bottle Logic. Black in color with a thin layer of tan foam. Smells like fresh brownies and fudge. Plenty of vanilla, some whiskey, and oak. Lots of brown sugar as well. Slightly boozy as well. The flavor is big on brownie batter, cookie dough, and graham cracker. Spicy whiskey, some fudge, and a touch of booze. Lots of hazelnut, vanilla, and caramel as well. Light coffee and roasted malts. Pretty solid, though not something I could crush a whole lot of.",3.93
310,Fundamental Observation,"Can't speak to all the vintages, but I was absolutely floored by this beer. Living on the East Coast this beer is obviously a luxury I don't come across often. Vanilla sweetness meets boozy but not overpowering bourbon! Thick and scrumptious mouth feel.",4.86
311,Fundamental Observation,Pours a straight black with light tan lacing. Low carb but enough to avoid a flat finish. Vanilla is present on the nose and overall vanilla held up very well despite being 4 years old now. Mouth feel is velvety smooth. Barrel is almost gone and oddly could've used a smidge more heat to balance the slight sweetness but this was excellent overall. Super easy drinking,4.68

Pours a dark black with tan head
Aroma is straight up bourbon infused brownie batter followed by vanilla and caramelized sugar, and hints of roast and oak.
Tastes great, complex mix of chocolate, vanilla, caramel and bourbon, little bit of roast.
Mouthfeel was full bodied and silky. Coats your mouth with chocolatey bourbon.
Over all one of my favorite BA stouts, its up there for sure. I think its a little over rated given its ranked #7 in its style, but regardless an amazing stout.",4.49
324,Fundamental Observation,"2019 release. Picked up a bottle at Hollingshead while visiting Orange on Beer Safari. Can always count on those guys.
All in all a bit disappointed. Just didn’t meet the hype for me. ABV of 2019 was down to 13.55% but head was fizzy and lacked any retention, lacing or halo. Beautiful dark brew with ruby/ teak accents to light. Nose was rich; full of dark fruits but only some wood or vanilla. Taste was surprisingly not so much toasty as more on bitter side. High carob dark chocolate. Vanilla bitter was prominent but also had bitter molasses notes. Quite a bit of dark fruit. Body was very bright and sparkly ... not to my liking...when cold but softened nicely as approached room temp.
Overall a very good old ale style imperial stout with true natural vanilla flavor. Have been to BL a couple times and have always been impressed with their BA Stouts, Porters.
Just had heard that FO was something special and didn’t find it that impressive.",4.46
325,Pliny The Elder,"After leaving VT and the likes of The Alchemist and Hill Farmstead, I didn't know how I'd find happiness in northern California. As we explored the hikes and wineries of Sonoma/Marin, we quickly learned of Pliny the Elder. That's when things started to fall into place. Pliny is the perfect combination of flavor and gentle enjoyable drinking for beer lovers. Our favorite pairing was Tony's Pizza Napoletana (Tony Gemignani, North Beach, SF) with a Pliny the Elder. Mmmm...",5
326,Pliny The Elder,Good? Yes. Hype-machine? Yes. Deserved hype? Not a believer in hype machines. But it does tick all the boxes it is supposed to. Nice 'n golden. Hoppy but balanced. Sassy bitterness to make it a dangerously drinkable 8%'er!,4
327,Pliny The Elder,"drank while enjoying the Browns v Chiefs game, at least for three quarters...",5
328,Pliny The Elder,"Was recently out in San Francisco visiting friends and had to get my hands on this legendary beer. Being a Boston guy, I am a bit biased to the NEIPA as the dominant IPA style, but this truly is the grandfather of the genre. Elder you might say. Anyways to the beer. It pours into a glowing gold with a frothy thick head that caught me off guard and escaped my glass. A casualty, but nonetheless we march on. Carbonation bubbles dance to the top of the head from the bottom of the glass. To the nose, piney/floral aromas tickle your nostrils. A sip and immediately you are met by a light bitterness, but a very fresh hoppy and pine like taste. A slight citrus aftertaste and each time you put it down, you are lured quickly to the next sip. Slowly you are warmed by the alcohol and once gone, you are left satisfied and disappointed you are out of beer. I'd compare it to tasting somewhat like a Harpoon IPA for my east coasters, but definitely a more impressive beer.",4.5
329,Pliny The Elder,Pale amber with an cream colored head. Good lacing,4.32
330,Pliny The Elder,"I'm not the biggest fan of hoppy beers or IPAs, but this is a wonderful beer brewed by masters. The other reviewers touched upon everything I have to say. Excellent beer.",4.16
331,Pliny The Elder,"On draft, 16 oz. pour. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2inch head. Smell is full of pine, citrus. Taste is piney, malts and citrus are present, significant bitterness. Feels medium/full bodied in the mouth and overall if you get a chance to try this beer, do it.",4.19
332,Pliny The Elder,"A generous share from Erland. Pours out to a slightly hazy pale straw yellow, forming a rocky white head with very good retention and lacing. Carbonation is moderate. The nose is mostly pine and then some grapefruit. A little bit of cat pee. Mouthfeel is prickly and lighter bodied than given the ABV, so I suspect white sugar is added here to thin this out. Flavor again is pine and grapefruit. Not overly complex with a firm bitterness and a dry finish.",4.14
333,Pliny The Elder,"Rich copper color and unctuous mouthfeel. Malty and hoppy. This is a very well-made beer. But as with so many pioneers in so many fields, the rest of the field eventually caught up, and this isn't as remarkable as it once was.",4.26
334,Pliny The Elder,"It is truly a beautiful rich and bright amber color in an eight ounce serving, inside a clear glass. There's a nice tight white head that seems to be perpetual. Despite the brightness and near translucenty, this has some body. Look at the lacing inside the glass, Wow! The aroma is of a good piney and biting hoppiness, but it's not overpowering. The taste is just about West Coast IPA perfect. That means there's a solid, but not sweet, malt body cleanly carrying a poignant resinous, yet dry bitter hop taste. Nothing out of whack, delightful across the tongue, rare is the beer better than this. A necessary advisory, this is from Philadelphia, three thousand miles away. It certainly must taste even better on the other side of the country.",4.61
335,Pliny The Elder,"This was a unicorn where I'm from. I've finally got to drink it and it lives up to the hype. It might not be revolutionary anymore but it's a damn near perfect example of beer style. If you don't like this than West Coast IPAs aren't for you.
Terrific.",4.66

337,Pliny The Elder,"A tale of 3 beers, all Pliny the Elder.
The first one I ever tried, courtesy of @jayorear in a BIF was transcendent- absolutely astonishing to me and my friend who I shared the bottle with.
We drank the second bottle about 10 days later and wondered if it was the same beer. It was still good, but just a WCIPA of average taste. Odd.
So now I’m trying one that is exactly 1 month past the bottle date and it’s back as the best, but not transcendent.
There must be a fairly narrow window for this to be at its best, and it’s that reason alone I can’t rank it all 5s.",4.69
338,Pliny The Elder,"From the can (IPA Fest in Cyberspace Provided), it pours a clear yellow golden color with a nice white head that remains for a long time. In the nose, it is citrus, mostly pineapple, and is enjoyable. In the mouth, it is the same, with a solid malt base. Very nice brew!",4.28
339,Pliny The Elder,Theres stuff out there now that can absolutely rival this but having a good bit of IPAS before this one I can definitely say this beer is actually as advertised. Super tasty. The review below me said something about how rare it is that hype meets quality and I agree and that review is from 6 years ago. This was just really good and at least to me Russian River stuff is getting much easier to get at least in Colorado.,4.75
340,Pliny The Elder,"The beer, the myth... the legend. It was of course a divine experience to taste is the first time- however, it’s a beer that you’ll gladly revisit at any chance given. A refreshing and amazing good old East Coast IPA, full of hoppy excitement",4.93
341,Pliny The Elder,"Nice orange body with a creamy head. Aroma is orange, mango, pineapple, papaya, passionfruit. An aroma explosion. Taste matches with the aroma. Very juicy. Good piney bitterness. Gentle malt flavor in the background provides a nice backdrop for the beer. Creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well concealed. Good body for an IPA. I usually have trouble taking down higher abv beers but this one is so well blended it's hard to tell I am drinking anything but heaven. A great beer.",4.66
342,Pliny The Elder,"Pours pale yellow with a 2 inch white head, which lasts. Moderate lacing to the end.",4.68
343,Pliny The Elder,"Living in MA, I don’t get this beer very often. I recently acquired 3 fresh bottles. It’s a good beer, it’s well balanced and dank but I don’t think it holds up to more modern ne/hazy dipas. I even think HT is much better in regards to a more American style double. That said, it’s a very enjoyable beer.",4.06
344,Pliny The Elder,"Bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. Deep golden to orange colour, moderate white head. Very nice hoppy aroma, fruity and herbal notes. Intense hoppy flavour, but not too bitter. Fruity and spicy notes, well balanced.",4.3
345,Pliny The Elder,A solid double west coast IPA that is smoother than most. I get the hype behind this beer but I don't find it as enticing as other double IPA's. Not my favorite from Russian River Brewing but definitely a powerful beer.,4.4

348,Pliny The Elder,"By far my favorite IPA. The fragrance is out of this world: yeasty, citrus, and overall super fresh. Taste is slightly bitter upfront but finishes aromatic and soft on the palate. I cannot wait to try more of Russian River Brewing Company’s stuff",5
349,Pliny The Elder,Just the perfect representation of what a West Coast IPA should be. Loads of pine and very slight citrus on the nose and palate. Clear. Wonderful balance between the body and hops.,5

Overall - a knock out!! Mornin Delight and I assume KBBS are only better because they have a sweeter taste to them. Hope to try KBBS soon! Coming in Dec for another release.",5

402,Fou' Foune,"De Labirratorium. En copa Teku. En cena de Nochebuena, con solomillo con pasas + gambas. De lo mejor que he probado de esta gente, de la que no soy muy fan la verdad. En esta al menos el suave toque a albaricoques logra contener la acidez y hace que resulte fácil de beber. No obstante, muy cara para lo que ofrece blancas + jamón + queso de oveja.",4
403,Fou' Foune,2019 bottle consumed 11/26/20,4.6
404,Fou' Foune,"A lovely beer with excellent apricot notes in the nose. The taste was a little too acidic and didn't have the depth of funk and fruit I would hope for, although it was especially nice as it warmed up",4.29
405,Fou' Foune,"L -- Deep golden orange body with moderate haze and two fingers of solid white head produced with gentle pour. Good retention and lacing
S -- This is indeed a very fragrant beer. Tons of fresh apricot, fruit leather, subtle barnyard funk, lemon acidity, hay, perfumed floral, mango, strawberry candy
T -- Great balance between the lemony tartness and oaky astringency of the base lambics alongside the subtly sweet fruitiness of the Bergeron apricots. Super complex and nuanced, this is not one of those completely out of balance sours that a lot of American brewers are producing these days
F -- Light mouthfeel, medium+ carb. Nice and lively, quite fluffy as well
O -- What an absolute surprise to see this suddenly show up for to-go growlers at Row 34 in Boston, especially in the midst of all that's going on in the world. At $40/32oz this is the second highest I've ever paid for a beer, just behind the $50 for a bottle of Drie Fonteinen Framboos",4.56
406,Fou' Foune,"2019. Poured from fridge temp. Apricot, mild funk nose, taste follows with mild barnyard. Very well balanced between culture and fruit. Light body, excellent carb.",4.7

408,Fou' Foune,"Drank at the brewery.
Hazy amber peachy color with a thin head.
Nice peachy aroma, fresh mint and orange lemon citrusy.
Flavor with notes of peaches, lemon, spices, wood, herbal hops and lactic acid. Dry and sour aftertaste.
Light body with mild carbonation.
One of my preferred beer from them. This was perfectly balanced with peaches at the right level, still keeping Lambic in the spotlight. Excellent.",4.47

411,Fou' Foune,"Enjoyed from bottle at Brasserie Cantillon. Modestly hazy and apricot-colored, with as much head on it as you care to produce when pouring. Bursting with fruit, moderate tartness and a touch of sour funk. Easy to see why this can be rated as the best Belgian fruit lambic around.",4.58
412,Fou' Foune,Poured into Teku. 2017 vintage.,4.66
413,Fou' Foune,"Right up front I will say that I am not a huge fan of sour beers. I find them a bit bracing and not the kind of beer I enjoy drinking. Having said that, I do find them an interesting category and this one, while a bit puckering, was not as sour as some of the sour beers I've tried.",4.16
414,Fou' Foune,2018 bottle sampled from a plastic cup at midnight in the parking lot of Forager Brewing awaiting Nillerzzzzz/Crema release the next morning. I can understand why someone might like this style of beer but the sour notes of the Belgian Fruit Lambics just are not my thing.,3.6
415,Fou' Foune,"Clear and gold. Small but satisfactory white head. Smells of all the apricots: fresh, dried, jam, pickled. Gorgeous. Got that medicinal barnyard funk but not too much. Exceptional apricot flavour, but with a certain dank turn towards sea buckthorn and pickle brine. Bone dry and perfectly sour: tart, not heartburny. A fantastic lambic and I can’t wait to drink it again.",4.72

417,Fou' Foune,This is a world-class beer all the way around. The apricots and earthiness mingle well together and the slight hint of tartness are amazing...This is a 2011 edition and it is drinking incredibly right now. I have to admit that I never thought I would ever lay eyes on this but I'm glad I finally got a chance to try this. It is simply amazing. I love the way that the sweetness of the fruits and the tartness of the beer play against one another here. I am very fortunate to be able to have had a chance to give this one a go. If you ever run across this I would highly highly highly recommend it. It is simply incredible...,4.66

424,Fou' Foune,"Had on tap. Finally got to try this lambic, was skeptical of the praise, but wow this was amazing! The apricot just explodes onto the palate on the finish with supporting flowers, hay, candi sugar, peach jam, pear, and funky yeast. So much fullness of flavor while maintaining a light, delicate and exception mouthfeel. Smell is not as vibrant, yet does put the spotlight on the apricot and peach yogurt (yeast) aromas.

Hazy orange juice appearance with mild head and lacing. Strong dank and tangy citrus aromas. Taste is a dank pine, slightly bitter, with a citrusy juiciness wrapped around it all-tropical, lush, flavorful. Light to medium bodied, a clean dry finish. I like how it’s not heavy on the tongue. A juice bomb, but a subtle juice bomb, if such a thing exists. Well worth the wait, and delivered on the hype.",4.75
435,Juice Machine,Pours a completely opaque dirty straw color with a half finger of head. The nose has very potent juicy notes - both tropical and citrus. The flavor brings the juice as well.

Overall: another great neipa from treehouse. Pretty soft and sweet but no unpleasant. The freshness is a huge bonus.",4.58
438,Juice Machine,"Pours opaque dark gold color, like pineapple juice, with a 3 finger soapy biscuit head. This is a seriously good looking beer. Aroma has rich, sweet citrus and mango notes. The flavor is strong with orange, pineapple and mango notes. It is a clean, dense taste that hangs in until the end. There is a touch of earthiness as it warms up The feel is very soft, heavy and substantial with low bitterness and a lot of effervescence, tingling the tongue well after the finish.
This is fantastic tasting, dense with flavor",4.5

Darker orange with white 1.5 finger head.

451,Julius,"Thanks to Roguer for helping me finally get ma hands on this in NBS BIF #14.
Wow, she's pretty. A turbid swirl of hazy golden orange pushes a most bountiful dense, white, fluffy head to the rim. The retention is solid, and the lacing is layered and clumpy.
Nose is bursting with citrus and slightly acidic tropical notes. Orange, grapefruit, and tangerine lead the way. Overripe mango, pineapple, and some pepper-like notes.
Taste goes in a little different direction. Definitely orange zest, grapefruit, tangerine, and mango. Puling some melon, pineapple, and peppery grass notes too. But it's going in a harsher direction than initially hinted at. More bold than balanced. There is still a lot going on that I like, but she's a bit more than assertive.
Mouthfeel is fluffy, active, with a bitter finish.
Overall, a very tasty, boldly hopped NEIPA. Maybe this can/batch was a bit stronger than usual. I'd love to give this another shot in the future.",3.92
452,Julius,"Canned 8/23/2021. Poured into teku glass. Not much of a head injury this one but still has some nice lacing. Beautiful peachy orange color. Peach and passion fruit on the nose.

455,Julius,Incredibly balanced in terms of aroma and taste. Mouthfeel like a stout as the flavor lingers on the palate. More of a savor then session type IPA but well worth it!,4.54
456,Julius,Deep hazy orange gold color with white cap and lacing.,4.49
457,Julius,"Pours a bright orange color, about the same color as the can with a medium bodied white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of oranges mainly. Tastes similar with big orange flavors, some tart grapefruit, and a hint of melon. Tart and juicy finish. Velvety medium bodied mouthfeel, perfect amount of carbonation finishing pretty clean. Overall an excellent beer, possibly one of my favorites from Treehouse.",4.75
458,Julius,"I’m not sure if I’ve ever rated a beer this high before. The color was an opaque orange juice. Nose was slight bitter hop with many tropical fruits and citrus taking center stage. Taste follows suit but bitter hop is almost not there, rather a slight dank taste is present on the back end but the front is all fruit and citrus puree. Mouthfeel is so pillowy and soft it’s reminiscent of a stout or thick porter. This beer was excellent and I will seek out more.",4.75
459,Julius,"I waited in line on Memorial Day for 45 minutes to pick up a case of this. Canned on 5/28. First impression: Quite good and very drinkable. Nice balance of hops and citrus. I think I prefer the more bitter mouth feel of Heady Topper, but this is a really great beer.",4.47
460,Julius,"For me, it does not stand above other neipa’s and ct style ipas in the manner I see so often described. Its very good beer but I don’t think its the best treehouse beer that I’ve tried. Definitely gives off Orange, tangerine even warping into mango. Its certainly luscious bodied and big... but it did not blow me away. But... when you’re expecting “the best beer in the world”... its not really fair to the beer, or your expectations. Excellent beer.",4.21
461,Julius,"Pours a deep flat orange color with a bit of sediment at the end of the poor. Head was thick and bright white. Nose fills olfactory senses with citrus overtones, but none specific. Taste was juicy with a bite of bitterness. No wonder this beer continuously scores 100",4.76
462,Julius,Can dated 4/5/21. Poured into a spiegelau glass.,4.75
463,Julius,"What a beautiful beer. As soon as you open the can tropical aromas fill the room! Such a beautiful beer, notes of mango and passion fruit were very evident. Balanced by perfect bitterness and a dry finish makes this such a drinkable beer. The hype train is real and I am travelling to destination ecstatcy!!",4.83
464,Julius,"Pours a beautiful orange juicy color with a fabulous big head. Aroma is different but really inviting. Not really juicy but hoppy is my best guess. I think I smell some malt in those hops. It tastes different for this style as it lacks any sweetness. I get citrus, grapefruit, passionfruit and maybe peach texture as it's mouthfeel is creamy smooth and lacks any bitterness so this is on helluva blend. I can see how tasters rate this very highly. It's awesome and reminds me of some other beers as this is my first Julius. I hope it's not my last. Special Thanks to my BA @TastersChoice Larry C for sharing this very awesome beer. A 16 ounce can dated 02/12/21 ""IT MIGHT AS WELL BE WRITER'S BLOCK"". My first TREE HOUSE. Two-Thumbs Up!!",4.77

466,Julius,Was gifted this when I turned 21 at midnight after a night filled with hydration. Being my first legal drink I'm not sure how it will ever be topped. I am definitely on the hunt to find a case of them to have on deck. This IPA is decadency at it's finest.,5
467,Julius,The original is still one of the best TreeHouse has to offer. The balance between hops and juiciness is top rate. Will always be my favorite TreeHouse beer.,4.66
468,Julius,"Growler @ Beachwood Brewing, thanks to Clark for this treat. Hazy orange with a nice white head. Wow, incredible fruit character on the nose. Tons of pineapple, papaya, mango, and grapefruit. Tangerine, some caramel sweetness, and blueberry. This smells amazing. Flavor isn’t as intense, but still quite good. Tastes like a blueberry muffin. Pine and herbal/weed bitterness. Moderate pineapple and mango with some grapefruit. Solid.",4.21
469,Julius,"A pint can gifted from a friend. And what a gift. As soon as the can was opened, I knew it'd taste as great as it smelled, but it was even better.

476,Very Green,Just another really really good beer. At a certain point all of these treehouse beers roll into one for me… the differences between brews are more subtle than with other breweries. They make “juicy” beer the right way: with the bitter necessary to make it delicious and the carbonation to make it luscious. Just crazy good.,4.28

TreeHouse Brewing
Date: 23 June 2021
My continued pursuit for all things Treehouse, this my thirteenth beer. I received this from a recent BIF, and it is fresh. I served it about 44 degrees using a generic tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a massive two-fingered head. Citrus emit as the beer is poured. The creamy and foamy white head dissipated slowly, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color of the beer charts around SRM 6, pale straw with golden yellow hues. This beer is hazy and sexy.",4.85
480,Very Green,"Pours a hazy yellow orange color with a light white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of sweet toasted malts, some floral and mainly citrusy hop aromas. Tastes mainly of citrus juicyiness, a hint of floral hops at the end of it. It's smooth, lighter feeling than it is, perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, an excellent NEIPA, as usual from Treehouse.",4.35
481,Very Green,"Great densely hopped IPA. Really intriguing to let it warm a bit and a little bit of grain and caramel actually come through as the label says. I think I prefer Green, but this is a great ""variant""",4.5
482,Very Green,"Looks like orange juice as do most beers of this style. Smell is pineapple and citrus, with dank hop underscoring the bill. Taste follows suit with a sweet malty finish. I liked this beer. It’s not bad by any means. But it is very similar to many other beers of this style both made by TH and other brewers. Will not seek again.",3.77
483,Very Green,Bought fresh at the brewery on 5/21. This is truly an incredibly made beer. It kind of reminds me of the first time I tried King Sue when I first got into IPAs -- it has the same general qualities of drinkability and flavor burst. I don't know how Tree House makes this drink so smooth.,4.99
484,Very Green,"Straight from Tree House. Canned 4 days ago. 16oz can into pint glass.

Feel - pretty full body and nice a creamy
Overall - Just incredibly good",4.68
488,Very Green,"Nice, but not world class. Canned on 3/23/21 so maybe more fresh is better?",3.85

490,Very Green,"Very Green from Treehouse. Received on 9/4/21 from @Rub_This_BBQ in NBW BIF #13. 16 oz can stored upside-down at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 14/4/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Bottom stamped “MY NAME IS VERY GREEN 03/011/21”. Served at 44.9 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 54.5 degrees.
Appearance – 4.25.
First pour – Pale Straw (SRM 2), murky and nearly opaque.
Body – Straw (SRM 3), murky and opaque. When rear-lite, same.
Head – Average (Maximum 3.6 cm, aggressive center pour), creme, high density, average retention, diminishing to a 12 to 14 mm crown and a medium rocky cap, fed by effervescence. Tiny worms of foam remain above the crown. Second pour produces a high density 0.6 cm head.
Lacing – Good. Head retraction and volume reduction leaves a slightly three-dimensional wide band of tiny to medium bubbles with a center ring of large bubbles where the band is attempting to split. See also above.
Aroma – 3.75 – Initial burst of generic citrus with tropical fruits. This rapidly fades leaving an extremely weak pineyness. No malt, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.25 – Begins bitter and resiny with generic citrus but lacking the typical terpenes of pine. No malt, no yeast. No alcohol (8.3 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. A weak gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 4 – Medium, almost creamy, lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4 Decent, sure, but not one I’d buy in any quantity. Still, I’m glad I got to try another authentic NEIPA.",4.06
491,Very Green,"Thanks to Rub_This_BBQ for this one, from a recent ninja box. 16oz can (dated 3/11/21) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a muddy orange color with an inch of white head that had good retention and lacing.",3.16
492,Very Green,"Sweet, tropical hoppy, bready/biscuity, slightly earthy/grassy, and orange citrus nose on this one! Taste follows with a juicy and soft, tropical hoppy, hint of earthy citrus finish...just great in the depth and mouthfeel department! This is outstanding!",4.43

494,Very Green,"pours orange with gold hue, dense white head that dissipates quickly, leaving plenty on the glass. aroma is of candied fruits and pine. taste has plenty of spice notes, nutmeg, pepper, and a bit of citrus juice and peel. not very bitter, plenty of bite but fluffy smooth as well.",4.01
495,Very Green,"One of the most dynamic taste experiences my mouth has ever encountered. The crack of the can unleashes a plethora of tropical notes and piny scents. It’s incredible and enough to fill the room. The taste profile mirrors the aromatic experience. It starts out in the tropics and then transitions to a dense pine forest. I mean I’m not kidding when I say this, it’s as if you crashed into an evergreen and you have to pick the needles out of your teeth. Finally, this beer smacks the back of your throat with an extremely intense hop bite that fads into a smooth finish begging you you to grab the glass and bring it to your lips once again. I can’t underestimate how lovely this beer is. It’s bold, it’s tasty and it’s an experience your mouth won’t soon forget.",4.7
496,Very Green,"I didn’t believe the hype. Then I drank the beer. Now I realize the hype wasn’t enough. Wow, what a delicious juice bomb of a beer. If juiciness isn’t your thing, don’t even try. If it is your jam, fasten your seatbelt. Amazing mouth feel, bursts of pineapple and orange aroma and flavor., and the 8.6% provides a kick. Must try for fans of the New England style.",4.6
497,Very Green,"RateBeer Best 2017. Milky golden beer with a white head. Grassy hops up front with some peach, orange, grapefruit, and non-descript tropical fruits. The flavor is pretty harsh, actually. Astringent and bitter. Meh. There's at least a nice hop profile there, too. But it's all kind of overshadowed by the aspirin thing going on.",3.28
498,Very Green,"Man this is dynamite. Pour is yellowish with nice tight bubbly head. Blasts of tropical fruits - pineapple, mango & guava with the pine in the background. The palate is luscious with a hint of malt to compliment the tropical and citrus notes. Tangerine and pineapple are the biggest takeaways. Finishes beautifully.",4.6

500,Zenne Y Frontera,Bottle. Generously shared by Seth. Clear light amber pour with a small white head. Mild funk aromas. Mellow caramel and oak notes give way to mellow horse blanket and barnyard backbeats. Smooth with less prickly champaign like carbonation. Very good mouthfeel and body. Simply outstanding.,4.48
501,Zenne Y Frontera,"Bottle @ La Palma Sour Fest 2015. Hazy orange colored beer with a small white head. Holy smokes is this funky. Tons of musty, damp, earthy basement and mushroom notes. Bright lemon and green grape acidity. Slight apricot sweetness and perhaps a hint of vanilla. Really nice mineral quality to it as well. Pretty citrusy and zesty as well. A winner, as usual.",4.42

507,Zenne Y Frontera,"Batch #2
A complex and unusual lambic, very unique character from the sherry barrel-aging.
Bright golden orange, thin layer of foam and spotty lacing.
Aroma is intense, woody oak, light acidic citrus, and complex caramelized sugars.",4.56
508,Zenne Y Frontera,"This is a landmark beer indeed. Big aged funk on the nose, yet so delicate on the palate. Slightly tannic, and a bit sherry-like (in a good way). One of the most balanced lambics I've ever had!",4.65
509,Zenne Y Frontera,Reviewed from notes- August 2016,4.7
510,Zenne Y Frontera,"I had this two days ago on Thanksgiving. The review is from notes. It was aged in 40 year old sherry barrels giving it some sherry flavor. I found it to have a Geuze like tart flavor, maybe too tart for some. However, I thought it was truly delicious and very refreshing as well as complex. If you like Lambics (and Geuze) I think you will agree.",4.82
511,Zenne Y Frontera,"Bottle at share from Todd. Orange/pinkish pour, flat. Fruity, sweet aroma, hints of brandy. Taste brings tartness, notes of grapes, hint of tomato. Earthy.",3.38
512,Zenne Y Frontera,"Drank season 17/18 blend no. 49. This is by far one of the best lambics on the market. Well balanced, flavorful beer. Our bottle had some carbonation and and great complexity.",5
513,Zenne Y Frontera,"Decanted at 3F. Perhaps the perfect all-around lambic drinking experience. Visually stunning- amazing bouquet. Taste was incredibly well balanced. Blends 3, 5 and 6 were all great, but 3 was my favorite.",5
514,Zenne Y Frontera,"Batch 2 so this was the solera. Little bit darker orange, great head. Great aroma of lambic and bright citrus along with some barrel. I could not pick out the sherry but could tell this was a different type of barrel then your standard lambic foeder/barrel that just has wood character. To be honest it really reminded me of Boon Vat 109 which is a great compliment to both beers. This was great, thankful to have a set of the new releases.",4.5
515,Zenne Y Frontera,"The beer pours a clear orange with no head. It smells and tastes of tart lemon, rustic funk, Sherry, and light cheese. Funky, but well put together and very easy drinking.",4.99
516,Zenne Y Frontera,"I've tasted several thousand different beers over the years. 10,000 plus check ins and at least that amount of different beers on a couple of other ""check in"" sites. Bottom Line: This is my favorite beer.....ever, to date. I can't say it's the best made or even the best beer I've had - it's simply my favorite. Amazing flavors, mouthfeel and finish. It has it all with great complexities and yet goes down easy and you want more. Good by itself or amazing with just about any food profile.",4.93
517,Zenne Y Frontera,"The nose of this showcases the sherry aged gueuze and the familiar drie funk. On the palate more of the same that funky cheesey gueuze goodness, grassy notes and tons of dark fruit and residual sugar from the sherry to finsh.",4.81
518,Zenne Y Frontera,"Sorry Contillon and Bokkenrijder, this is the best lambic I have had! Worth the hunt, worth the money, worth every single minute you give it. Wow! It is almost hard to put into words how much is going on, yet so much on a delicate scale. Plenty of sweeter red wine elements, grapes, sherry booze, lemon, plus other fruits like orange, peach and pear. Then there is the hay, earthy, and beet sugar base that crops up in fun and balanced sips. Plenty of funk, barrel elements and oak to boot. Little bit of everything, amazing!",4.75

Don’t get me wrong, this bad boy is Uber sweet but it’s exactly as advertised. It’s literally a liquid version of chocolate cake. As it warms up the bourbon, oak, vanilla start to show up. Really good body and mouthfeel.",4.34
527,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Had this stout at Angry Chair on 3/20/21 so I’m guessing it’s a 2021 bottle. A very nice guy sitting at the table next to me offered a pour from a bottle he was sharing with a friend to my wife. Needless to say, I drank her pour. Jet black color with a little bit of foam. Smells like chocolate with some light bourbon notes. Taste is the best chocolate I’ve ever tasted in a stout. Rich, sweet chocolate balanced perfectly with a slight bourbon taste. Mouthfeel was also perfect just coating the tongue. This beer blew me away! I’ve had the non BA Version years ago and it was very good but this is in a league of its own. The best pastry stout I’ve ever had. The first perfect score I’ve ever given on beer advocate.",5

535,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,Poured from a cracked bottle (damaged during shipping) into a styrofoam cup in the parking ramp over my work lunch hour. After I opened the stained shipping box to find that the bottle still had about 6 ounces in it I decided I just had to try this. Glad I did. Amazing beer loaded with chocolate. Creamy and smooth. If not for the acquisition cost I'd go after another of these.,4.75
536,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Those of you that actually read past the fact sheet on my reviews know that I carry a strong inherent bias against pastry stouts because I don’t handle sweetness very well. Some of you may have also noticed that I don’t seem as disenchanted when it comes to barrel-aged stouts and barleywine, when they sometimes taste as sweet, if not sweeter than other representations of pastry stouts available on the market.",4.45
537,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Dark black with a pretty thin tan head. Smell is pure vanilla and coconut. Taste is out of this world, one of the best things I've ever tasted, period. Coconut up front, smoothing out into pure chocolate flavor that really does taste like German chocolate cake. The only knock I'll give it is that the barrel doesn't come through a ton in the flavor, but it's hard to call that a negative when it tastes this good. Pretty sweet, but not painfully so. Smooth feel, maybe I'd like it a little bit thicker, but again - this is just quibbling and it's hard to really knock this at all. Fantastic.",4.99

Aromas of fudge and subtle coconut release from the glass. Smells like dessert! Flavors are insane. Pretty sweet with fudge brownies, coconut and subtle Barrel/oak. Amazing flavors here. Like I’m sipping on brownie batter. Feel is viscous and mouth coating. Pretty sticky. Overall, this was a treat. Dessert in every way!",4.75
545,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Poured from a bottle. Motor oil look and pour. Coconut fat floating on top. Smell is coconut, chocolate, vanilla, barrel, amazing. Taste is all of that, plus adding that perfect thick and chewy mouthfeel, you get the perfect beer.",5
546,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Great beer, but I have to say for the value and what I gave up to get this I would rather go for the non ba version. Great beer, where I think the bourbon barrel actually does not add a lot cause there are so many adjuncts. Definitely a chocolate bomb.

554,Abner,"Poured from a can. Failed to capture the date but I believe from a fall/early winter release.

561,Abner,L: Straw w/ a little bit of burnt amber in hanging around,4.41
562,Abner,"Pour like most cloudier ipas but it isn’t murky at all, which is nice. Has a lingering opaque head, no lacing but that could be the pour since this beer usually has some nice lacing. Smell is fruit, mainly citrus lemon and orange to me. Taste follows same, sweeter citrus tangerine, Clementine, sweeter orange (cara cara, if you haven’t tried one do it you’ll thank me.) It finishes with a grapefruit bite. What separates this beer from other hazy beers is that it is not thick and cloying or heavy at all. It finishes pretty dry too and has a soft bitterness that is very pleasant and goes well with it. Glad I get to drink this guy once a year, always an enjoyable experience.",4.35
563,Abner,"Canned 4 days ago and poured into a pint glass (only ""beer"" glass available at time of pour). Pours a glowing, hazy orange / yellow. Modest head that leaves behind some nice, thin lacing. Aroma comes off the beer in waves of tropical, hoppy goodness. Taste is a nice combination of citrus & tropical notes, but with just the right balance of hops and a tiny bit of bite. Medium carbonation and a medium to medium full mouth feel. Overall, while I'm not a huge IPA fan in general, I have to admit this is a great beer.",4.46
564,Abner,Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold. Huge citrus and fruity aroma. Taste is a tons of citrus but not a juice bomb. You get some bitterness but not overly bitter. Just a perfect balanced hazy ipa.,4.73
565,Abner,"Shades of lemon and gold capped by a solid two fingers of eggshell white head that settles nicely leaving cave pattern drawings in its wake. Aromas of honeysuckle, pine, apricot flesh, pineapple, light malt, and lemon zest. Taste follows with piney notes up front, pineapple juice in the middle, a bit of orange peel on the back, as well as the slightest hints of peach. For the amount of hops used in this beer, they're integrated seamlessly. It coats the palate; soft up front, creamy in the middle, and finishes somewhat dry. I could drink this one all day long. Superb.",4.57
566,Abner,Quarantine bonus! Armsby Abbey in Worcester selling growlers to go of this legend. Pours hazy dark orange. Creamy mouthfeel. Pine hits me first then subtle citrus. Fantastic dry DIPA.,4.63

568,Abner,"Opaquely hazy yellow-orange with a fluffy, lumpy white head that displays good retention and clings in ridges.",4.18
569,Abner,Poured into a pint glass from a growler filled the same day (Aug 10). Opaque and deep. Medium-bodied for an NEIPA and pungent in a piney/musky sort of way. Tasted like the apotheosis of the style. This is special.,5
570,Abner,"Excited to try this. Expectations high given its reputation. On tap at BeerShop, NYC.
Pours a hazy orange color with a thumbnail length frothy head. It is juicy looking and inviting.
A medley of tropical, citrus and stone fruit opens the aroma. In addition, there is a touch of dank and herbal aromas evoking resin, floral sweetness and a touch of onion. The malt aroma is bready with a hint of honey and caramel sweetness.
Juicy flavors all the way redolent of all kinds of fruit. Notes of pineapple, grapefruit rind, orange peel, tangerine, peach pit, and mango. There is a developing bitterness that adds balance, along with herbal and spicy hops flavors. Notes of floral hops, pine, grass, onion. There is a mild and clean alcohol spice at times. The malt profile, although mostly secondary to the hops dominance, nevertheless has notes of biscuit and honey.
Medium bodied, moderately crisp and a carbonation that is on par. A dry and resiny finish yields a lingering bitterness.
It was a delicious pleasure drinking this one. It was like a hops explosion in the mouth that represented a bouquet of complex flavors. One of the best.",4.75
571,Abner,"Drinking this in a dark bar so hard to get a good read on the appearance. Faint (very faint) notes of grass/earth and citrus rind on the nose, would expect more aromas from a HF IPA",4.19
572,Abner,"L: Beautiful deep cloudy orange with 1 inch of frothy white head. Poured into a tulip glass from a growler, filled @HF the day before.",4.96
573,Abner,"Growler fill dated February 2019 - very fresh. Beer doesn't appear to have settled at all - no floaties, no hop residue, no yeast. Lightly hazy in appearance, a bit gold around the edges, beautiful orange otherwise. Smells terrific - hoppy and citrusy.",4.56
574,Abner,"Abner is perfectly balanced and not a pure juice bomb. The nose is pineapple and pine. The taste is less citrus and maybe more pine. The finish is clean but not crisp, a bit of a sweetness. Overall an exceptional NEIPA.",5
575,Double Sunshine,"Quick review, can purchased at brewery:
Mostly clear with strong lacing; Nose is a bit light, fruity; taste starts a little sweet, with a hint of burn, but balances quickly and then slowly becomes bitter. The Transition is nice, only mild complaint is I wish is started just a little less bite. Awesome beer, and I'm mostly finding smaller detractions to bring it down from perfect.",4.77
576,Double Sunshine,"I finally got this up in Vermont this summer. I was expecting too much from it based on other people's ratings. I actually prefer SOS to the double. Don't get me wrong, this is a great DIPA, but I am getting bitter taste from the hops rather than the sweet taste I get from SOS. I love how this beer is clear, amber from the delicious malt, well-carbonated, and easy to drink.",4.41
577,Double Sunshine,"Pours a clear crisp orange-yellow color with a thick but airy white colored head that laces nicely on the way down. Aroma of floral hops, earthy smells and some sweet malts at the end of it. Tastes of toasted malts, nice earthy and slightly citrus hops and a warming alcohol feel at the back end. Thicker feeling than it looks, warming, nice amount of carbonation. Overall, this is what I miss about Double IPAs made in New England.",4.46
578,Double Sunshine,"This is worth driving to Waitsfield for. I worried it was a gimmick, not different from Sip. It's better than Sip. which I already like a lot. It's more more more compared to Sip. Nice job Lawson's!",4.93
579,Double Sunshine,"I don't know about this one... the strong ABV negatively offsets the ""sunny"" taste. Two weeks old and it shouldn't be this boozy. For my money - and opinion - the original ""Sips"" is significantly better.",4
580,Double Sunshine,"Exceptional IPA. Similar to Sip of Sunshine but definitely better. Brewers like to use the phrase ""bursting with flavor"" but this beer really is. Aroma and taste are everything I want in an IPA. No hazy, chalky, yeasty crap just a great, strong, balanced beauty of a beer. I think it's better than Heady Topper. yb",4.75

582,Double Sunshine,L: Clear orange yellow with decent head on top. Modest lacing.,4.51
583,Double Sunshine,"Deep gold with excellent clarity; white head; poor fizzy cap retention, yet solid ring; some spots of lacing. Nose is dank earthy mangoes, orange, lemon, grapefruit. Bitter lemon peel right off the bat; mango and orange earthy hop middle; semi sweet malt foundation. Bitter bite/burn on tip of tongue; medium body, moderate carbonation; some warmth/astringency in mouth. Tasty long citrus rind linger, but bitterness overshadows the malt and it tastes/feels hot, even though I don’t detect any alcohol and abv is just 8%; I’d drink again, but I’ll know what I’m getting in the bitterness department.",4.34
584,Double Sunshine,29JUL20 saw a second visit to Lawson's in 2 days for Alewife and myself. Went with the Double today (Triple yesterday). A 12oz pour was $7.00.,4.13
585,Double Sunshine,"Bought a 4 pack fromt the brewery. Had to say, this beer underwhelmed me a little bit based on the ratings. Its still a good beer, but had a strange blend of sweet and bitter combo that just felt a little like a fight going on in the beer.",4.26
586,Double Sunshine,"An excellent, excellent beer but, for my taste, not as good as most ratings. I'm NOT slamming this beer at all; I'm just saying that there are many of this style that are more balanced and generally more drinkable.",4
587,Double Sunshine,16 oz can into glass,4.06
588,Double Sunshine,"Lawson's Sunshine is a staple here in New England, and my go-to IPA if I'm in the mood for something strong. That's why I was surprised to see a Double IPA version. It ups the ABV by about half a percentage point, but takes some of that brighter, happier notes and brings it down a few notes to be sweeter and a little stickier. It's strong, but still well balanced and intense. This is a good ""last beer of the night"" and only with a DD, but the strength delivers some tasty hop notes without being burly or clumsy.",3.92
589,Double Sunshine,"Look...golden yellow with little haze
Smell...familiar, remembrance back to the first time I had sip of sunshine earthy hop
Taste...very similar to sip with a twist of bitterness at the end. Definitely old school IPA really good
Feel...slick kinda oily. full . Sticky hop awesomeness really nice DIPA

593,Double Sunshine,Great citrus aroma. Absolutely refreshing. Edit: to be fair this was the first ne dipa I’ve purchased and first ipa review. In fact I only happen to put this in my virtual basket order because I needed to meet the delivery min for my order of stout parabolas. The kind beer-smith threw these in to top off my bill. Wow am I ever grateful.,5
594,Double Sunshine,"Canned 01/29/20. Picked up at the brewery during a February ski trip up north.
Yep, it’s this good. One of the original Vermont IPA/DIPA names that put the New England craft beer scene on the map before the haze and juice bombs started. This is executed almost perfectly. The balance, the hop character, the finish and feel. It’s all industry standard and so approachable. Wow.",4.7
595,Double Sunshine,"Pours clear copper orange. Smallish white head.
Smell is ruby red grapefruit and pine.
Taste is grapefruit and citrus. With a bite of piney bitterness at the finish. This is a very well done old school Ipa. It’s actually very is too drink for an 8% beer. Alcohol is hidden so well. Watch out. Maybe a touch over rated in. My book but very good",4.2
596,Double Sunshine,"Double Sunshine use to to be a fancy waxed bottle""whale"", but now you can buy as much as you want at the new brewery. I am a big fan of the East/West coast mashup and this is a good example. The nose and taste are tropical fruity notes and are balanced by a strong malt backbone and subtle bitterness. It is strong and the alcohol is there, but it is melded well with the hops and malts. Definitely a step up in flavor from SOS",4.5
597,Double Sunshine,"Excellent DIPA.
I was lucky enough to drink it at the source and also bring home a 4pk.
Finished the last cans at 3 months old and they were still singing.
Clean, clear, bright aromas and flavors.
Great beer, phenomenal brewery.",4.6
598,Double Sunshine,Copper colored with a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering a third of the top. The aroma is of of pine. I’m tasting a wallop of pine and a touch of grassy hops. The mouth is sticky and chewy.,4.28
599,Double Sunshine,"16 oz. can from Brewery (also sampled at Brewery): this one pours a cloudy slightly orange tinted golden color. Minimal head and lacing. The nose is good. A mixture of many hops with none overpowering the other. Tropical, pine, citrus and some floral/herb notes. A little muted from what I expected. The taste is wonderful. A plethora of different hops, all well balanced against one another. Some dank hops, with tropical, pine, citrus and maybe a bit of some herb flavors. Now real sweetness to this, just a bit of a dank hop bite. A really excellent beer.",4.34
600,Bourbon County Brand Stout,2020 edition. Blown away by this one. I’ve been spoiling myself with good stouts lately and this is definitely the top of the heap. Bourbon is really prominent in this one and really smooths everything out. The world class rating is completely appropriate.,4.88

603,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"2020 vintage marked on label. Drink by 22JUN25 printed on bottom of back label, so I've got 4 years to finish it. Bottle picked up at liquor store for $10.99. Poured into Duvel tulip.",5
604,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Pours a crazy dark opaque black with a thick, well, purple head. The nose is incredibly intense with bourbon and dark fruits. This beer is not messing around. The taste is a complete punch to the face. Waves of intense chocolate, followed by bourbon, followed by coffee. Woody notes and hints of vanilla throughout. Whoa.",4.6
605,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"From a 2019 bottle. Pour left a very quickly receding brown foam head that reveals a dark brown to black body. Scent is very, very bourbon heavy along with notes of burnt sugars, vanilla, and molassess. Taste is much more on the sweet (caramel, butterscotch) than alcohol side, although the high ABV really bleeds into the aftertaste. Such a fascinating array of flavors that must be consumed slowly (both due to the ABV, sweeter flavors, and alcohol aftertaste).",4.15
606,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"A good friend brought this to MN from his home in WS, and it is his favorite. It could be mine if I could find it. The score indicated on this site is well deserved, such a complex and flavorful beer. BUT, like some of the other high-alcohol beers one has to be careful. One cannot stop drinking but in so doing can find himself passed out.",4.75
607,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Pours vantablack in color with a somewhat thin espresso head with decent retention; bitchin legs on the side of the glass. This beer has a lot of complexity... Smells rich of roasted malts, vanilla, dark chocolate, dark fruits, bourbon, oak, fair amount of hops, sweet, boozy. Taste very much follows the nose, has almost a spice like warming aspect to it, the booze is all there. Full-bodied, low carbonation, super warming, syrupy, thick, oily, chewy... Really quite phenomenal. A stout worthy of a celebration.",4.71
608,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Well there’s a lot of hype surrounding this beer. Big brew that “sold out” to anheuser Busch but people still flock to get it. The original bourbon barrel aged stout that so many others have copied. I finally found it in a local shop I’ve never been in before and they had six on the shelf. $15. I am drinking the regular flagship 2020 vintage so the bottle isn’t very old. Poured out into a snifter as suggested a deep dark brown with very little head retention. Smell is absolutely delectable. One of the best smelling beers I’ve experienced. It’s very richly bourbon, sugary, maple syrup and molasses. Just wonderful. Really makes me want to drink it. So I do. And it’s fanfuckingtastic. Rich fudge, maple, chocolate, vanilla, smoked out leather. And a huge chord of warming bourbon that fills the mouth a good half minute after swallowing. And mouthfeel is thick and juicy, moderate carbonation. Overall I’m impressed, and I love big stouts like this so I’ve had a fair number to compare it to. This brew is like an old rich guys high backed leather chair sitting in front of the fire wearing an ascot and smoking a fine cigar kind of delicious. I’ll definitely be returning to this again for special occasions.",5
609,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"2017 Vintage.
L- Black, kind of tan head
S- Hint of smoke to it, caramel and dark chocolate
T- This one hits a little boozier than other iterations I've had. Has the chocolate, real classic caramel and vanilla barrel characteristics.
F- Mouthfeel on thicc but not quite oily as others say, carries the heavy flavors along perfectly.
Oldest BCBS I've had so far, not my favorite but it holds up to the others.",4.46
610,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"It's truly a great stout. I remember when it used to be affordable. Despite the price per bottle of this brew it's still definitely one that you should try if you haven't. Sweet and viscous with a little bit of an anise flavor in the finish, it's a brew I wish I could get more of.",4.83
611,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Have had several year's ""vintages"" of this outstanding brew. While it packs quite a punch, it is delicious to drink. Usually make a point of grabbing several bottles when in the Windy City.",4.74
612,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"As one of the top beers, this one has some high expectations to live up to. Which it pretty much does all the way.",4.5
613,Bourbon County Brand Stout,Always a solid 4.5. Great barrel even now that it is mass produced. Also a great beer to use in a French press with other things like cinnamon toast crunch. Easily one of the best shelfies to pick up. It is a thick beer that has a great barrel smell to it and a nice thick mouth feel. The look isn't anything out of the ordinary other than slightly more brown foam to it that I noticed more.,4.49
614,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Damn good beer, and I'll try to keep the review short.",4.64
615,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"This one is unique and a special experience. I took my time and with each sip got lost in a medley of vanilla, roasted coffee, chocolate, caramel, charred wood, and bourbon. My only regret was that I was tasting this one solo, and not sharing the experience with a friend. Will have to save a few bottles and share post covid....or maybe not ;-)",4.8
616,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Tasted this in a flight for black Friday 2020 with a three year virtical.
had the 18, 19 and 20 releases on tap. plus Carmella Liked the 18 best it was coming into its own very well. Big bourbon on the 19 and 20 as expected but the 18 had overall mellowed wonderfully.",4.31
617,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Great look. Head goes away somewhat quickly but otherwise a nice dark look. Smell is unbelievable - vanilla bourbon is clear and strong with the stout smell to round it out. Taste is also excellently complex, with smoky vanilla bourbon and a more traditional stout at the front. Feels fantastic with low carbonation and a long cholacte-adjacent aftertaste. Superior Brewmanship.",4.8
618,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Pours a jet black with very little head. Mostly just tan bubbles. Smell and taste is a wonderful blend of molasses, vanilla, and some spice you get from the bourbon barrels. Mouthfeel is medium and one of the easiest stouts I’ve ever had to drink. Overall, many barrel aged beers are too boozy this one is perfect in blend.",4.67
619,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"It's pretty perfect. The barrel delivers, creates multiple tones of creaminess, boozy, balanced, some years are better than others, but all around a must try!",4.89
620,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"2020. Excellent BCBS year. The balance on this years OG is excellent. You get bourbon, oak, chocolate. The chocolate really comes on strong after the finish well after drinking.",4.75
621,Bourbon County Brand Stout,"L: black cannon fodder. Carmelly head.
S: slight roast, carmel and chocolate.
T: Heavy bourbon on front and back end. Taste is pretty ubiquitous from year to year- 2020 brings a little more old school roast.
F: Thick and tongue coating. Creamy and a meal in itself.
O: Top notch as usual. I love the base beer from year to year. Its consistently great, specially at the price point. Great barrel character, perfectly hot without being fusel. Chocolate and bourbon driven.",4.74
622,Bourbon County Brand Stout,2020 version. I took this out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for thirty minutes before pouring.,4.6

2019 edition
Light brown, medium bubbled head. Very dark and opaque brown appearance. Caramel and toffee syrup and some toasted bourbon barreled characteristics in the aroma. Not syrupy, bold toffee, caramel flavors with smooth heavy roasted grain with slightest hint of blackstrap molasses, dark chocolate and trace of licorice, during taste. Rich but not heavy mouthfeel and a smooth dark roast finish.",4.58
625,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"I'm not gonna get all fucking scientific or anything... I won't be describing 20 different fruits, tastes or 20 different feelings... it's just a good beer! The taste of alcohol doesn't smack your ass down hard at all... it just happens to be perfectly balanced and that's it... St. Bernardus or Rochefort will hit you straight in the face... I can't taste the plums, cherries, orange peels and shit... all I can taste is a strong ass beer that has been done right... take it or leave it...",5
626,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Look: it looks like it's a light brown, with touches of orange, it LOOKS like light should be able to penetrate through it, but it absolutely does not",4.48

I always drink this beer after work or after cycling and I don't eat any sugar drinks or food before so I will taste it maximum.

629,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Usually I blind-taste beers but I've read so much about this one over the years I certainly know of it's reputation. That said beyond being a monastic Quad I do not presently recall any specific points/features of this beer and have not read any reviews below (yet!)... I don't know what to expect, am I 100% honestly going to find this a 'Score:100' beer?
This is my 2,000th beer rating/review so it had to something with the prospect of wowing me; fingers crossed...
L- Dark chestnut red-brown. Pours with minor haze with some sediment left in the bottle. Head forms swiftly, take the pour slowly. 3Cm pale tan head. ps@+10mins a patch of bubbles holds the whole way down.
S- Quite malty with a light hint of spice.
T- Woah!! Ok, well THAT got my attention. Instantly deep and roasty-rich, notable ABV% brushing my palate and a good balancing hoppy-bitter aspect into the finish.
F- Big, rich + 'visible' ABV% but well balanced by hops.
O- Made for slow-sipping. Lovely, complex and big yet mostly refined. The ABV% is unusually loud for 10.2% and that surprises me. (I had an 18.1% yesterday less shouty on the palate than this one). FWIW I'm tasting this on a clean palate. My wife tried it after eating chocolate and didn't get the ABV-zing. Nice. Would I drink it again? Yes if I could drive to the brewery and buy it for peanuts. Worth the after-market price? Certainly once...
Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed!
330ml bottle BB: [xx]-01-2026 Euro16-00 Bought from [xx shop]/Belgium as part of a large pick-your own consignment to London. The xx's being to anonymise people who perhaps have breached their required agreement with the brewery not to resell this beer.",4.29
630,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),Thought I’d never score one…much less three…thanks Michele!,5
631,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),Had this in Aruba …. Reputedly best beer in the world at the time. It was damn good…. Best beer in the world good?… it was good…. Not worth the 30-50 bucks I paid for it though,4.27
632,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),P: Deep light brown. Large head which half dissipates,4.65
633,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Took me about three years to get a six pac into my cellar. Fortunately, I have relatives who fly to Belgium once every 4 years or so. I'm down to my last 2 remaining .
Read a lot about it, finally got it in hand and it was and is quite glorious. I like almost all of it , just the ABV is a real kicker.
Look is superb, the head is quick to dissipate, scent is complex and rich, sweeter than I thought.
Flavour is rich and deep and changes pretty dramatically as it warms. Lot of figs and molasses, I think they might have currants and apricots in there too.
Nice to sip and say these are some of the great moments in life. It's a rarity and should be enjoyed. Bucket list is to go to the Abbey and maybe go for 3 glasses on tap and taxi back to the hotel, drunk and happy.",4.99
634,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"(2015 vintage) I'm not a lover of the dark fruits character that tends to result in aged dark beers but that's what i got. Suffice to say, the taste was the most mellow that I've ever experienced. Like a fine wine, it did keep some of its Belgian Quad character and it was outstanding.",4.75
635,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"After waiting for many years to try this beer, it was very good but not the best quadrupel I've ever had. It has some nice dark fruit (fig, date, raisin) notes but it's surprisingly boozy. I no longer feel a need to acquire a case for aging purposes.",4.18
636,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"got 1 bottle of this beer as a gift from my polish friend .
Thanks Rob
about 3 years old this bottle
poured a 1finger head into glass the taste was special complex chocolate flavors malty and smooth . brown sugar and molasses
a great sipping beer to drink on special occasions.
overall the best strongest beer I love the complex flavors and smell of the beer also.
probably the first and last time I'll drink one of these.
I'm happy that I had a chance to have 1 bottle .
cheers",4.49
637,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"It has been a few years but I had this beer in Europe and, by luck, in the US as well. I was in a bar in Amsterdam and asked if they heard of this and the bar keep said ""ya,"" but could not carry it. Not willing to drive up to the abbey and get one case. But, he said, there was one place in the city he knew of that carried some bottles. ""Where?"" A block down the street. I bought the last two on the shelf.",4.79

Not sure how available the '12' is in the US anymore but I know I was very lucky to find it. In fact, the obscure little wine shop in Baltimore where I bought the only two they had is not in business anymore. Drank the 1st one two years ago and it was memorable. The one tonight is just as exceptional.",4.86
640,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Big thanks to my best friend Jon Passow from A Starter and a Chaser podcast for sharing a bottle of this with me. Getting to try this certainly is a big beer milestone for me. Poured into a goblet glass, this beer pours a dark ruby color with some bright ruby/amber highlights when held up to the light. Has a just slightly off-white/tan head that's about half an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with a film layer of surface foam. Aromas of toasted, bready, caramel malts followed by dried fig, plum, yeasty esters, a hint of cocoa, a bit of leather, and hint of sweet , Red Delicious apple. Tastewise, the flavor profile is very similar, with the aforementioned toasted, caramel, bready malts along with plums, figs and just a hint of Red Delicious apple. This is followed by some Belgian Candy sugars along with a bit of yeastiness and just a hint of cocoa and leather here too. The flavor profile does change and get a bit more complex as the beer sits and warms up. Just an absolutely fantastic flavor profile. Has a smooth, fairly frothy, slightly creamy, also still somewhat crisp, medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish, and all the flavors stack around on the inside of my mouth on my palate for awhile after each sip. WOW! This is just a really excellent beer, and certainly the best beer of this style I've ever had.",4.68
641,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),2 fingers of khaki head which slowly dissipates to about one finger. Dense foam which leaves a surprisingly nice amount of lacing despite the abv. Body is translucent amber-brown.,4.64
642,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Been a while since I wrote a review, but this is worth the time. Worth the hype, especially if you love quads. Smell is amazing, plum, dark fruits and sweetness. Flavor follows the nose. What's most surprising about this beautiful beer is that it's not heavy as you'd expect from a quad and it's the perfect amount of sweet. Truly one of the best beers I've ever had.",4.71
643,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"BBE: 15.02.22
L: Very nice thick, bit brownish head. In color dark-dark brown, not able to see through against light. Holds nice lacing.
S: Caramel, burnt sugar, nuts, dark cherries, alcohol, plums, raisins, hint of dark bread.
T: Tastes better than smells with most of the descriptors listed earlier, i.e plums, caramel, raisins, etc.
F: Really creamy, medium/full bodied. Has a nice balance of bitterness and sweetness. Like most of its peers, the brew hides the abv. Strange bitter-sweet aftertaste (astringent?)
O: Excellent quad, although too pricey (bought for 24€). If it would be cheaper, I would visit this ""piece of Belgium"" more often. For now though, I'll stick with Rochefort 10 (which I actually prefer more..)",4.5
644,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Delicious, all the hype well deserved. The main thing for me is the creamy feeling and how smooth the taste. I really can't say I have experienced that with any other beer.",4.94
645,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"This beer absolutely deserves the hype. In fact, this is the best beer I have ever tasted. I agree with most of the previous favourable comments re its taste, smell, mouthfeel and absurdly quaffable nature (particularly given the 10.2% ABV) but I would also like to add that I completely agree with those who recommend a 12-16 degree (celsius) drinking temperature. This means you take one out of your cupboard/safe/bank vault and put it in the fridge for only 15-20 minutes...the complexity really comes through at this temperature. In contrast, a friend once drank a cold one as a 'travel beer' on the Tube (Subway/Metro) on his way home at midnight (when heavily drunk). Obviously he is no longer a friend.",5
646,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Great, but not the best. I would even dare to say St. Bernardus Abt 12 is beter. Don't get me wrong, it's among the best, but the hype around it destroys it's own imago. Give Abt 12 a shot, a touch better.",4.41
647,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),Poured from a bottle brought back from the source - clear dark mahogany with thin off white head leaving spotty lacing. Nose is malty with lots of dark stone fruit and spice. Taste follows with an uptick of the nose and a smooth creamy finish . Brought back memories of nights at the Kulminator. Outstanding.,4.75

Taste is complex very fruity, raisins, dates, port, caramel, treacle. Medium body and highly drinkable for the big abv, smooth in the mouthfeel, lasting boozy bitterness and fruity tastes remain but booze is not overpowering just warming. I was surprised I got through all 4 of my bottles as quickly as I did, without much of a struggle and was sad when they were all gone as I'm not likely to pay £70 for a box of 4 again anytime soon.",4.35
650,Dinner,Beer rating is very subjective.,5
651,Dinner,"Pours a clean but hazy orange color with a short and medium bodied white colored head that laces the glass a bit on the way down. Smells of sweet toasted malt and then a floral/piney/citrusy hop aroma. The taste is of sweet toasted malt and tart grapefruit followed by floral/piney hop finish. It's crisp, lighter bodied than expected, warming, and a bit dry at the end. Overall, excellent!",4.49
652,Dinner,"Their own description of “ dry, refreshing and hoppy. We really focused on hop flavor” is perfect. It’s all and only those things. Very bright. Quite carbonated off the tap.

Not that I’m telling you anything you don’t already know!",4.43

655,Dinner,"Poured opaque but not murky, golden honey in color with soft billowing head of vanilla white foam which left lacing all the way down the glass.
The aroma was such that I really wanted to smell it for much longer, citrus and fruit (pit fruit, I think) and a hint of pine.
The taste is pretty much everything I think a good IPA should be, balanced hops and malts with citrus shining bright and dankness playing along, all nicely counter balanced with mild malts. So good.
The feel is darned near perfect, smooth and soft and way too drinkable. Pretty sure I could drink gallons of this if it were on tap.
So good, so glad I got to try this. Thanks to WunderLlama for sending it to me.",4.75
656,Dinner,"Pours a cloudy, but not opaque golden orange color. A lovely thick white frothy head forms on the beer, linger for a long moment, then slowly collapses leaving just a ring of foam along the outside of the top of the beer. Lots of sticky white lacing coats the glass as the head recedes and to a lesser extent as the beer is consumed.",4.6
657,Dinner,"Incredible look, strong golden hue, great clarity. It poured with a nice 1/2 inch of foam, laced around the glass. As refreshing as it looked, I had a fantastic full mouth feel, effervescent. Although a double, it’s subtle and easy to drink. There is a pronounced hoppiness that clears. It’s just overall refreshing. Tantalizing citrus, nectarine bouquet. Excellent!",4.65
658,Dinner,"Enjoyed 6 days after the born on date. Color is a bright amber; opaque, but not hazy. Head fades to a thin white with some slight lacing. Smell is citrus and stone fruits with some dankness. Taste follows with the citrus being more prominent. Medium bodied and smooth across the tongue with a little bitterness that lingers. Very easy drinking for the ABV. Would seek this out again.",4.6

660,Dinner,"Fresh ass bottle. Cloudy light yellow pour with a white head. Enticing apricot bouquet. Wow, impressive. Big apricot and nectarine flavors. There is a hoppy bitterness but it’s secondary to the stone fruits. Good balance with plenty of caramel malts. Good body and mouthfeel.",4.34
661,Dinner,"I travel to Vermont .... you know for what. It's really good.
I travel to Mass ..... you know for what .... It never really excited me.
But when I travel to Freeport, Maine ..... and DINNER is fresh and available ..... I believe it's the best beer made in U.S.A.
Yes $8.00 a bottle is extreme ..... but I think it's worth it.
Best taste in a DIPA.
Incredibly easy to drink.
They have it often ..... so it's not quite as "" unique "" anymore ..... still only available at the brewery.
Worth the trip .... I promise !",5

Tastes like a top shelf New England IPA, but for all it’s hoppiness, not a hint of the soapy quality some of the IPA/DIPAs can have. The bitterness and grassy notes were balanced with tropical fruits and some warm, yeasty flavors. Even non-IPA lovers, like my husband, can enjoy this one.",5

672,Dinner,"Dinner is surprisingly hazy for an Imperial IPA. It is golden mango (SRM5-7). A quick, glistening cascade finishes shortly after pouring and builds a fluffy, one and a half inch tall head. The head slowly fades, leaving dense, froth lace on a PBGC IIPA Pub glass.",4.41

I find it less complex, juicy, flavorful and unctuous (in a good way) than the other two. This seems to hold true with Very Gggreennn for me. It’s a very good offering however, a notched improvement over Green and Very Green. Tropical notes of banana, pineapple with some hibiscus and other floral notes. The flavor profile is decidedly dry with bitter hoppy notes which couple with those tropical fruit notes. The bitterness lingers on the finish.",4.52

694,Very GGGreennn,This is the highest rating I believe I've ever given a beer. IMO this is better than Juice machine and KJ. So soft and so mild compared to the overly hoppy stuff they've churning out. No hop burn whatsoever. So rich and delicious. It's like Honey Dew Melon Sorbet in a glass.,4.74

Gorgeous beer. Poured it into a wine glass (my preference for stronger beers) and it was almost as delightful to look at as it was to taste. Big beautiful brown head. Coffee is the prominent note in this, chocolate taking second place. Top notch stout, I see what the hype is all about.",4.97

I preferred the Mackinac Fudge one. This is definitely top notch, ill have to try it again I think. This one hundred percent tastes and feels great regardless I guess I was just hoping for a smidge more balance but who knows maybe next bottle.

T: Maple, bourbon, char, oak, coffee, tobacco, brown sugar, bakers chocolate, leather, raisins, dark figs, light marshmallow, candied cherries. It is moderately sweet.
F: It has a firm medium-bodied mouthfeel, fair carbonation, is rich yet thinnish and has a medium-long finish.
O: This flavored stout has a purpose-built bourbon and cask flavor and is ready to drink or can be cellared to a vintage of your choosing. In an optimum storage environment it's flavors will change well over time. It is robust, woody, bourbon, cocoa, vanilla. Excellent in it's style.",4.74

Smells as advertised: chocolate plus coffee, plus a background of dark roasted grains. Taste follows the smell. Nice, heavy body with light to moderate fine carbonation in the mouthfeel. No overt feel of all that ABV. In fact, not a lot of presence of that bourbon barrel aging taste or feel, but overall very nice. I do have an issue paying $5/12 oz when there are nearly equally pleasant stouts for at least a dollar per bottle less.",4.77

Flavor of dark roasted almost burnt coffee. Bittersweet chocolate with some vanilla come through with pretty heavy alcohol heat. Little bit of barrel character as well.
Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Mouthfeel is a little bit thinner than I expected.
I had very high expectations for this but unfortunately I did not enjoy it quite as much as other barrel aged stouts I have tried. That being said this is a delicious, well made beverage.",4.33

Wish I could do this live, but here it unfolds as it happens. Taken from frig, very small pfftt as I pop the cap. Pours into glass...very dark color...head and legs like Marilyn Monroe...nice but getting old. Aroma a bit malty, but my sniffer pretty much got snuffed decades ago. Carbonation tingles the tongue, chocolate is there but not a Willy Wonka dream. One reviewer claims it improves as it warms, so I'll try to resist guzzling for now, but it's good stuff. Definitely smoother as it warms, and more bourbon and coffee flavors. Getting frothy as I swirl it in mouth. Given it's a ""breakfast Stout"", would probably be good with pancakes. Definitely better as it heats to room temperature ( or at 12% ABV, maybe it's me). Feed the cats (they love it when I sit on the floor). Beer warms some more. Chocolate seems more pronounced now. Only a few swigs left...will be sorry to see it go.",4.16

Roasted malts and coffee but in a semi-sweet German/Swiss chocolate bar. The burnt and bourbon flavors match perfectly. I waited until 59 degrees and got a 3/4"" head. I appreciate the lack of simple sugars giving this a dryer taste than one would expect. Alcohol is actually well hidden here in my opinion in taste though it is very present in the nose from the bourbon. Big difference. Big body, Curvacious and complex to the 9th. Do this.",4.94

719,KBS,"From a bottle, pours as an opaque deep brown with a two-finger dense khaki-colored head. Aromas of sweet-malt like molasses, cocoa, dark roasted coffee, toasted/burnt bread. Taste is very malt-forward (so rich coffee roasted barley and cocoa flavors - but also - an oppressive sugar load). Nicely, this brew, clocking in at 12.3% alcohol, manages to NOT taste ""boozy"" (the totally sugar masking that). Mouth-feel is creamy and full.

This treat is a lovely scent with a well toned sourness, and a touch of banana esters that play second fiddle. The central sourness on the tongue is also tuned to perfection, with just a slight edge twisting the salivary glands and a lovely carbonation.

Taste follows the nose, being quite sweet and absolutely dominated by maple syrup and caramel, lightly roasted malt, with lighter notes of coffee, chocolateand lovely vanilla bourbon notes, as well as a certain earthy, woody oak presence. Finishes bittersweet, with a light bitterness and an almost cloying maple sweetness lingering in the aftertaste. Thick mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.",4.15

Opaque black body supporting a creamy and regenerative brown head. Lacing is sparse, but there are some oily legs.",4.46
800,Blessed,"Dark, oily appearance. Smell is sweet, vanilla, chocolate fudge, waffle cone, and bourbon barrel. Taste is much the same. My first beer from Anchorage, and its an Incredible BA Stout, a bit sweet, but not sickening and wanting more.",4.74
801,Blessed,"Poured pitch black with out any head. The nose is delightful, faint coconut, vanilla, chocolate. Not really any bourbon, but the barrels does seem to add a level of complexity, enriching all these decadent smells. Upon first sip, just hints of coconut as well as the vanilla and baking cocoa. Neither of the three dominates, it’s all extremely balanced. Sweet but not overwhelming! Hints of barrel presence as it warms up. Mouthfeel is perfect, full body but no heavy warmth. Overall: I find this to be a easy sipper. Some heavy stouts are best shared but I could easily finish this bottle. It’s that good!",4.53
802,Blessed,"Thick pour, nose shows light coconut and vanilla (but no overpowering), taste is not too sweet with noticeable barrel characteristics - well balanced, mouthfeel is smooth and still, a great and generally easy to obtain release from an amazing brewery.",4.75

804,Blessed,"Pitch black body, oily brown legs. The vanilla is absolutely decadent on the nose and palate, with the coconut being mild but mixing things up a bit. Big full body, sufficiently light carbonation, massive vanilla ice cream flavors on the finish.",4.74

Great body. Well worth it, but cos t a lot to purchase.",5
809,Blessed,"I went in to this beer expecting a barleywine, because Anchorage - but I was pretty confused when it hit my tongue. Loads of rich, thick milk chocolate, vanilla, and coconut. The bourbon and oak are understated, but there - I'd like a bit more, so that the diabeetus juice doesn't quite overwhelm it, but it's still fantastic. I wish I'd bought a few bottles of this - blessed be the friend who shared with me!",4.75
810,Blessed,"One of my favorite stouts ever. Such a strong coconut and vanilla taste that really had me wanting more . Such a thicc boi as well, highly recommend trading or searching out for this beer.",4.96
811,Blessed,"Drank a bottle of this recently. Thick and viscous used motor oil pour that smelled of coconut, vanilla and marshmallow. Huge aroma on this. Taste was good with tons of coconut and vanilla but I also found it to be cloying. VERY sweet which really took away from the beer. Feel was great. Nice and viscous. Mouth coating. This beer hit some of the marks for me but really was just too sweet in the flavor department. Wish it were toned down a touch.",4.37
812,Blessed,Thick Diabetes in a bottle. The Coconut and vanilla come through perfectly. It almost like drinking your favorite cake. One of the best overall beers Ive had.,4.89
813,Blessed,"This one blew me away! Poured like motor oil and was close to pitch black in color. Silky thick mouthfeel. Chocolate vanilla flavor was off the chart, but was not overdone. Very sweet pastry stout, but was not cloyingly sweet...just right.",4.94
814,Blessed,"From Tavour. Refrigerator kept since purchase. Not as thick as some describe. Pitch black, and silky except for the coconut floaties, which for me detract some from the appearance. Smell is divine - what I'd imagine it might smell like inside the factory where they produce Mounds candy bars. Taste almost matches the smell, except it is a touch too sweet, and lacking enough barrel heat to balance it out. Overall, I need to knock it down only because the drinking experience doesn't meet the price of entry. Considering that, I'd be much happier with a 750 ML bottle of Shared Coconut Vibes.",4.44
815,Blessed,"This is suuuuuper sweet coconuts with some to spare. Thicc doesn’t begin to describe this, on the level of coconut vibes. Crazy and excellent and too much for diabetics!",4.79
816,Blessed,Absolutely pehenomenal beer! Pours pitch black in a snifter. Super sweet coconut on the nose with barrel adding complex sweetness. Super smooth with a nice sweetness when tasting it. Tastes like a tootsie roll. One of the best beers I have ever had!,4.87
817,Blessed,"Blessed. A perfect name for this beer. Anyone who gets to try this one is truly blessed. It is everything you want and unrivaled. The beer is a combination of 1 year and 3 year barreled stouts. The color and flavor are deeper than a dark dungeon on Halloween. The near burnt caramel resonates in every sip. It mimics the best dessert/sauce you ever had, like it came from a three star Michelin pastry chef. When poured, the black elixir resembles an obsidian robe. There is also a bombardment of high quality vanilla bean that layers on top of everything else. The beer just takes you to a different place and deserves to be recognized as elite.",4.96
818,Blessed,"This beer is next level. Reminds me of OG Vanilla Rye on steroids. Has a bit more barrel and vanilla. Overpowers the coconut a bit but the sweetness is perfect in my opinion. Glad to be lucky enough to have acquired a bottle, really nailed it here.",4.96
819,Blessed,Black-waxed 375ML bottle. The wax appeared to have a touch of concrete mixed into it.,4.7
820,Blessed,"Bottle from Tavour. Dark as night, flat, slick. Roasty, ashy aroma, boozy. Taste is sweet, roast malts, chocolate, and vanilla. Liquid nectar. Worth every penny.",4.74
821,Blessed,Pours out the most sinful black conceivable. Even poured aggressively this yields no head whatsoever. Looks like syrup being poured into my glass.,4.88
822,Blessed,Used motor oil black with a short but intensely dark burnt mocha head that fizzles out quickly to reveal a few brown floating speckles on the surface. I haven't had a pastry stout with floaters in it for a minute!,4.8
823,Blessed,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.",4.51
824,Blessed,"Opened for no good reason other than to have a fresh tasting. Poured cellar temp, moderately fast to a tulip glass. Color is menacing, deep, dark, opaque brown/black. Forget about any head. This stuff comes out thick like oil, leaving a heavy trail on the glass as it’s moved. Nose is very sweet vanilla, with a mix of subtle coconut. First sips are heavy on the vanilla, not cloying, seemingly balanced by the coconut and heavy malt foundation. The bourbon is aromatic with your nose in the glass, brings a tiny harmonic presence in the sip, but then really comes to roost once the sip is gone. I’m nursing these sips, considering the absurd price point, but a mouth full puts the whole symphony into action. The mouthfeel is extremely thick, which I always enjoy, though I deducted a small amount, wondering if a little lighter might have opened up the profile more...it could just as easily be a 5. The alcohol has no bite whatsoever; totally smooth at all points. It’s so thick and bombastic, I could see pouring this over some fresh whole bean vanilla ice cream. Oh, that would be good on a hot night like tonight. This is usually a cold, dead of winter type beer for me, but I needed to try it fresh, lesson learned from my BA Ten Fidy experience. I only consumed half the bottle, leaving some to enjoy tomorrow...if I can hold out. It’s a beast to be sure, not an every day drink, but a nice first-world luxury. For the per ounce price point, Utopias might be the more complex, refined, and charactered beverage, but if I spend this much on beer again, the missus might not be so forgiving. I’ll call myself “blessed” and move on.",4.98

Amazing complexity with a nice drying finish that tapers off quickly. Pricey but understandably so",4.59

Deep red in appearance. Barely any head. Looks like Juice.
Smells like a funky cherry pie in a good way. Tons of cherry and that’s typical Cantillon funk.
Taste is amazing. SO much cherry with slight funk. Really delicious.
Feel was as expected. Proper body and nice carb. Very drinkable.

841,Lou Pepe - Kriek,"Was surprised to be able to find a 2012 750ml that could be consumed on site at Hill Farmstead. Beer is a murky ruby red in glass with pick 2 finger head. Aroma is a blend of sweet fruits and earthy funkiness that blends really nicely together. Taste is amazing. A perfectly blended mix of all the good things I like in a Belgian Lambic/sour and done better than most any I've had to date. It's only slightly sour, mixed with tartness and sweetness from the fruit, but finishes so clean. No syrupy sweetness on the back of the tongue like you get from some other fruit beers. It was quite the highlight of my Vermont trip to finally get to sample something from Cantillon and if I can't have it at the source in Belgium, then sitting at Hill Farmstead on a 75 degree sunny fall day sure isn't too shabby a venue either.",5

Purchased for $7 from a private collector because let's face it i can't get it here in ohio so i might as well get it from someone who can. i've heard a lot about this beer and i'm excited to try it. i pour it out and it's immediately got a 3 inch head, probably among the biggest heads i've ever seen. Color is a very hazy peach / mango. Smell is all citrus, all day long. Orange, lemon, mango, peach, any of those light colorful orange colored fruits is what we're smelling here. Taste follows the nose and is extremely light and refreshing. This is like drinking a cold glass of orange juice, but pure and a bit lighter. Mouthfeel is light, thin, and quite carbonated, with a dancing effervesence that tickles the palate. Residual taste after a swallow is orange and lemon peel. This is as good if not better than Resin, one of my favorite beers. I could drink this all day long. The ABV is a little under what my taste palate likes, I prefer the heavier beers, but I have to review this beer objectively and it's quite good.

865,JJJuliusss!,"Jjjuliusss! from Treehouse. Received on 9/4/21 from @Rub_This_BBQ in NBW BIF #13. 16 oz can stored upside-down at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 13/4/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Bottom stamped “I LOVE SPORTS, BEER, AND WU-TANG 03/09/21”. Served at 48.0 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 58.2 degrees.
Appearance – 4.25.
First pour – Pale Gold (SRM 4), murky and opaque.
Body – Pale Gold (SRM 4), murky and opaque. When rear-lite, same.
Head – Large (Maximum 5.5 cm, aggressive center pour), creme, high density, good retention, diminishing to a 15 mm meringue-like cap and crown. Three-dimensional narrow bands of foam remain above the crown. Second pour produces a high density 1.7 cm head.
Lacing – Good. Head retraction and volume reduction leaves an irregular three-dimensional narrow band of tiny to medium bubbles with occasional wide columns connecting to the next lower band and oddly mutated stalactites. See also above.
Aroma – 4.25 – Moderate generic citrus with distinct guava and tertiary pineapple. No malt, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.5 – Begins bitter and resiny with guava and generic citrus. Some pineapple on the aftertaste. No malt, no yeast. No alcohol (6.8 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. A weak gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 4 – Full, creamy, lively carbonation followed by an acid bite.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Well, a true NEIPA at long last! Certainly hoppy and citrusy, with IPA bitterness and good old palate-coating resinousness. At the low alcohol content of only 6.8% ABV, several of these would go down very easily.",4.33

It’s so subtle I’m wondering if it’s fallen off, as it’s promoted as super citrusy. It has juicy citrus notes with orange and grapefruit prevalent, but the tangy fruit flavors balance well with a strong piney bitterness. Medium bodied, smooth, easy sipper.

That is one dark beer. No color highlights. Small dark beige head.
Deep rich fruit on the nose.
Really nice chocolate flavor that is bittersweet. Yummy. The abv is not over-powering in flavor enhancement but it hits quickly. The dark fruit lies in the background a bit, like dark chocolate on berries.

892,Parabola,"Black motor oil with a great nose of roasty chocolate and bourbon. The taste is quite similar. My bottle has been aged a bit, so it's got some oxidation. Great beer, pick one up if you see it.",4.34
893,Parabola,"650 ml bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. ABV is 12.5%. Pitch black colour, moderate to low tan head. Intense roasty aroma, notes of dark bitter chocolate, tar, tobacco, leather and coffee. Same elements in the flavour, intensely tarry and rich, salty finish.",4.25
894,Parabola,Brown reddish color. Stains the glass a bit. Get charred oak and bourbon followed by cherry tartness and finishing with just a bit of coffee. Excellent beer. Very complex.,4.5
895,Parabola,"Pours pitch black with a little tan head and a healthy brown ring. Smells like bourbon, vanilla, a little coffee and chocolate. The flavor is smooth bourbon, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, and the oats make it super silky. Everything blends very nicely as is the case with most FW barrel aged brews. One of the best stouts, no doubt, buy it it if you see it, cheers!",4.65
896,Parabola,Look: black with brown edges. Basically no head,4.69

898,Parabola,"12 oz bottle poured into a teku glass. Pours dark deep brown/black. Khaki head falls off quick to a thin collar. Smell is coffee, cocoa, tobacco, oak, bourbon. Smell is deep and strong. Taste follows nose with vanilla, coffee, cocoa up front. Starts a bit bitter and roasty. The middle gets sweeter with the cocoa, some cream, and bourbon dominating. Finishes with tobacco and a bit of chocolate covered raisin. Feel is full, fairly carbonated, but with a soft creamy finish. Overall, this is a really nice beer. Good evening sipper. May try to get a few bottles more to age. It's deep, rich, flavorful, and highly enjoyable.",4.58
899,Parabola,"Parabola 2020. Enjoyed 7-28-20. Oak, plum, sweet tobacco and chocolate on the nose. Chocolate and plum and oak on palate with a caramelly finish that leaves a sticky film on the tongue.

901,Westly,Bottle generously shared by Seth. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Sour apricot aromas. Big sour apricot notes dominate. Super sour but still damn tasty. Good body and mouthfeel.,4.35
902,Westly,"Bottle @ RateBeer Best 2016. A later pour from the bottle, so a little bit chunky, but fine with me. Intense apricot and just overall juicy fruity quality to both the aroma and flavor. Pleasant lemon and citric acidity here without being over the top. Notes of lime, grape skin, and oak to go along with all the apricot. Really nice.",4.31

905,Westly,"Sweet and tart apricot, and mildly funky and acidic saison aromatics on this bad boy! Taste follows exactly with a beautiful, tart apricot swallow! There is some hints of a oakey wine notes hidden in there. This is so well-balanced and feels great on the palate! Outstanding!",4.84
906,Westly,"Foggy orange, appearing slightly lighter around the edges, with a short but persistent fuzzy blanket ridged at the collar with one long arm of lace reaching around half the glass.",4.3
907,Westly,Pours hazy and orange like a New England IPA.,4.69
908,Westly,"This one pours a hazy bright orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.",4.49
909,Westly,"I had been wanting to try this one for a very long time and it didn't disappoint at all. So much apricot, but not too sweet and very drinkable. This one lived up to the hype.",4.75
910,Westly,"07/2016 - This is incredible - hype realized! Gueuze-esque; peach, apricot, funk on the nose; wee cinnamon, fruity, barnyard taking over the palate; acidic, yet still oh so clean of a finish; dope!",4.66
911,Westly,"Pours a clouded amber-orange color, with a froth, stable head.",3.74
912,Westly,Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Sante Adarius tulip glass. Drank right after tasting West Ashley Thanks Jake for the trade.,4.74
913,Westly,"2017 bottle poured into a SARA bulb. Bright orange with some haze. Small white head forms and dissipates quickly. Smell is of stonefruit, funk and acidity. Taste is amazing. Ton of stone fruit, subtle funk and acidity. Super balanced. Feel is very nice. Actually found this to be a little “thick” and was very effervescent with the bubbles. Overall, this is an outstanding beer and deserves the hype. Thank you George for sharing!",4.69
914,Westly,"This has a beautiful apricot color with deep stone fruit flavor and refreshing medium mouth feel. It's very balanced and well made, just don't expect anything super complex. I don't see the need to pay the price to acquire this, but it's certainly a very good beer.",4.5
915,Westly,"2015 B2. Had at apricot share with about 35 other apricot sours and siasons. Top notch apricot saison. Thought the finish is what separated it from other apricots. Great smell, and terrfic light airy, not that sour. I woulds say this and La Fosse B2 one the share for me. I love Fou but 15 was a little lack luster compared to westly.",4.81
916,Westly,2014 batch drank on 4/2/2017 side by side West Ashley,4.85
917,Westly,"The rating is from memory of tasting Westly 2014 (4/2016). Had Westly 2015 on 2 occasions and for me, even on a slightly fatigued palate, 2014 was far better.",4.75
918,Westly,"Overall pretty epic, it takes everything I expected West Ashley to be, but much more mellow and deep in flavors. After this and Fou I am a believer in apricot sours!",4.4

S: Nectarines, Meyer lemons, tangerines, and apricots on the nose
T: Huge jammy notes of apricots, orange marmalade, and an acidic orange juice
F: Amply carbonated with a moderate mouthfeel
O: This was simply incredible. For me, West Ashley fell a bit flat, but Westly flat out impressed me. Hands down this is one of the best apricot sours on the market and blew West Ashley, Fou, etc. out of the water. Highly recommended and an absolute treat to imbibe.",4.83
920,Westly,"Pours a orangish yellowish hazy color. Mild head retention. Smells of acidic apricots with a nice barnyard funk. Taste is incredibly balanced with the tart, acidity predominate but very smooth. There is not much alcohol taste with this high ABV. One of the best wild ales I have ever had.",4.78
921,Westly,"Ok this looked more like orange juice than any beer I've ever seen. Nice, pulpy orange juice. Aroma was of citrus lactic sourness.",4.47
922,Westly,"wow! thanks to drlovemd87 for sharing this rare gem, its always a pleasure to get to share these with close friends. this might represent the final evolution of the apricot wild ale, and after being only lukewarm on the west ashley (in regards to all the hype), this one really takes it to the next level. twice the apricots and twice the time in barrels! the pour is hazy short of rusted orange, pale and soft looking, no visible particulate in here, but still sort of raw looking. nearly a full inch of airy white head lingers. the aroma here is near perfection, about is forward as apricots have ever been, including allagash, cascade, crooked stave, and yes, cantillon too. its juicy and bright, sweet enough, even fuzz on the outside just a little bit. oddly nutty like the pits but that could be a handover from the wood. the fruit is pulpy and ripe and dominant, but there is a great mixed culture sourness backing it up, cutting the sweet, and highlighting some of the wheaty grain base and oak treatments, all well integrated and powerful, but also quite mellow and approachable as they go. the flavor is still really ripe apricots and interesting funk and sour combined. the fruit is incredible here, maybe a step short of its explosive aroma, but really pungent and to the point. it tastes like a fresh apricot in the peak of the season, as true to the fruit as any of the beers out there. its quite sour too, a lot of lactic acidity, ahead of the wild funk aspects, and well ahead of the oak. it gets even more sour as it warms, which it does in this instance because i cant put my glass down to stop smelling it! a bottle of this might be a lot as a solo mission, so i was really glad to be sharing it. i could see the acidity getting overwhelming. its like too much of a good thing, a third of a bottle was exactly perfect. probably the best expression of apricots i have seen in a beer, and the white wine notes from the wood and the yeasts are a great compliment to the fruit. easily the best of the beers i have had from these guys, and probably the new benchmark in the style. unlike the west ashley, this is entirely worth all of the high praise it gets! a memorable experience.",4.55
923,Westly,"A delicious beer indeed. Bright orange color pours with virtually no head, juicy fresh apricot and hay nose, bright stone fruit vinous juiciness with a funky tartness that just leans on the edge of sharpness. In a vacuum, this beer certainly stands on its own merits. However, I can't help but to weigh the vast difference in the cost of admission versus West Ashley/Fou as compared to the difference in quality, which is, in my humble opinion, marginal.",4.56
924,Westly,"On tap at CBC 2016. Pale golden with a thin white head. Apricot, brett, some citrus and fruit sourness. A good sour beer, but not as good as the hype surrounding it.",4.25

Smell - nice slight peach wild ale smell
Taste - Fantastic peach easy going slight tart
Feel - Crisp with a medium body
Overall - just fantastic",4.43

927,Fuzzy,Blend 4. Delicious and well balanced lambic style fruited Wild Ale with Loads of peach and stone fruit flavors. Nice and tart but not overwhelming. Love this beer.,4.5
928,Fuzzy,"Bottle @ Perennial. Hazy golden pour with a tall white head. Super fresh, juicy peach nose. Hints of lemon juice and green apple. Some light oak and white wine as well. The peach flavor is great, but the lactic sourness is just too aggressive to be a supremely crushable beer. A nice juicy fruit sort of tropical character and some nice grass and damp wood funk.",4.22

931,Fuzzy,Review #500: Side Project - Fuzzy,4.39
932,Fuzzy,"Bottle courtesy of jeffreed61.
Labeled as blend #4.
L: hazy tangerine juice. Slight carbonation in the glass, which funny because it wouldn’t stop overflowing out the cap for 10 minutes.
S: Peaches, tart, funk.
T: peachy goodness. A little funk. A little sweet. A lot of sour. Almost like sour candy. Some notes of lime, vanilla, oak, barn.
F: slick and dry. Mouth puckering.
Overall: Solid all around. Didn’t enjoy the gushing out the bottle but otherwise great.",4.36
933,Fuzzy,"Moderately hazy golden orange body. Not a particularly long lasting or fluffy head despite the robust effervescence. Huge aromatics -- akin to Cantillon Fou Foune -- of overripe peach, apricot, fruit leather, tropical fruits, acidic lacto character, some barrel. Flavors are hugely tart, perhaps a bit heavy-handed, with a crisp and refreshing body. Definitely a sharing beer, I split a 750ml between 7 people and felt that I had just enough and any more would have been overwhelming. A solid wild for sure, but lacking the subtle funky complexity of, say, a good Belgian lambic or a Hill Farmstead barrel aged mixed fermentation ale.",4.29
934,Fuzzy,Blend #4.,4.64
935,Fuzzy,"Absolutely spectacular in every way. Had a 375ml poured into a tulip glass. This is a beer I will remember for a long time, maybe even haunt my dreams. The flavor and intensity builds on your palette but doesn't leave an after taste.

940,Fuzzy,Tasted from bottle. Blend #2. Pours a hazy gold with white head. Big sour funk aroma of lacto with peaches. Taste is very sour. Flavors of peaches with lactobacillus. Very nice peach flavor with a lot of pucker.,4.33
941,Fuzzy,good peach sour. long finish. ren's bottle. spider lace. not overwhelming sour. very fruity. a delight. great balancing. A bit of orange fruit colour.,4.04
942,Fuzzy,"Everything's just peachy at the Side Project brewhouse when the brewery takes their Missouri raised fruit and embellishes a Brussels' styled sour ale. Aided with chardonnay barrels, the character of this sour ale simply keeps building.",4.31
943,Fuzzy,"Truly one of the best sours out there. Hard to get your hands on but worth the price. Unfortunately, when you get a pour or bottle it does not last long. I had this at Side Project bar in early 2017, visiting a friend in St. Louis. I believe it was the second batch, good haze with a bright orange. Had a sweet complexity of peaches that developed into everlasting funky, earthy, acidity that beckoned another sip. Must try if you are a sour lover.",5
944,Fuzzy,"B1 Starbright, mid-high clarity, champagne effervescence, appropriate head and retention per style, straw-green hue; errupting notes of underipe apricot and peach, lemon zest, lemon juice, flesh, damp slate, damp grass, damp barnyard bedding; under and over ripe peach, apricot, peach pit sweat, lemon rind and juice; pleasant and thin feel with appropriate effervescence, residual and cloying acid and sugars;",4.65
945,Fuzzy,"On tap at Beavertown Extravaganza. Aroma is funky and floral with unripe peach and apricot and hay notes. Taste is tart, fruity and lactic with some fruit pit bitterness.",4.3
946,Fuzzy,"Had this at the Firestone Walker 2017 Invitational. The long line paired well with the hangover I was nursing in the heat. Pours innocent and yellow with a chunkee or two floating around and a super thin mild head that was gone before I took a sip. Wow, what a great aroma. Peach, brett, barrel, funky yet dry. Pretty top notch in that department.",4.24
947,Fuzzy,"What an excellent beer. Amazing nuance and waves of flavor. Perfect fruit balance. Very well done. Best beer at Shelton Bros ""The Festival"" 2017 IMHO.",4.92
948,Fuzzy,"Had a 4oz pour at a bottleshare. Look wasn't anything crazy but the smell was so complex showcasing barrel,funk, and loads of peaches in perfect balance. The taste was both jammy and some dryness in the back. The feel was medium and effervescent. Overall a great BA fruited wild ale that i hope i can get my own bottle to share with the wife.",4.72
949,Fuzzy,Shared a 375 from the most recent batch with my brother. This was my first beer from side project and I think he gave away a little much for it. I like this beer overall and was very drinkable. I thought while tart and sour it wasn't over the top like some are saying. At the same time it wasn't very bold. I could have crushed the whole bottle to myself easily but in the same vain of IPAs I'm not really a session guy. Just expected something more.,3.93
950,Ann,"Bottle generously shared by Seth. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. The nose is somewhat bland with barrel highlights. Real smooth with good carbonation. Light citrus and orange notes with floral/herbal and woody undercurrents. To be honest, after all the hype, I was expecting a whole lot more.....",4.02
951,Ann,"My long time white whale, we meet at last...",4.52
952,Ann,"Awesome to finally try this; great wine, light funk, touch of honey up front; Anna’s funk and honey comes through nicely, with nice sweetness, grains of paradise, mild mild tartness in back; the honey pops as it warms, super flavorful, floral finish. Wow.",4.65
953,Ann,"Glad to cross this one off the bucket list. Shared at HF. Golden pour, baby finger sized white head, no lacing. Aroma of green grape, white wine, oak, apricot, white peach. Taste is something else, oaked white wine, apricot, peach, light cellar notes, white grape, hay, picking up a light honey-sweetness and very light funkiness. Lighter body, carbonation holding up pretty well.",4.83
954,Ann,"Batch 4, 375mL bottle served into a bulb glass onsite 4/18/18.",4.75
955,Ann,"The beer pours a Clear bright yellow with a thin white head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells of citrus, lemon, oak, honey, vanilla, and a little brett.
It tastes of citrus, lemon, honey, oak, vanilla, tangerine, wine, and lightly tart on the back end. It is very light, clean, and simple. This is the perfect beer, doesn’t have a ton of wine or funk, but doesn’t need it. So easy to drink and goes down fast.",4.94
956,Ann,"A: Pour is slightly cloudy, with a golden yellow hue. Head is about a half inch, with great retention and generous lacing",4.63
957,Ann,"Finally, after a few years, and some adventuresome and muddy miles, she landed. Soft golden hue, fluffy juicy head, gently wine, oak barrel, and microflora tones both on the nose and taste, and silky smooth. Definately matches up with the hype.

960,Ann,Pours a gorgeous honey gold with a beautiful white head that retains well and leaves ample lacing.,4.9
961,Ann,"2014 Vintage from the taproom. Finally got to have the beer I have most coveted since I started visiting the enchanted beer mecca in 2013 and have proceeded to make the trek once a month since. All the trips finally paid off as it was there for on-site consumption. Had side by side with Le Sarrasin and Being and Time which might have thrown off the overall ranking. This was smooth as silk, fluffy clouds, extremely pleasant with where the base honey beer accentuated the wine barrel. The smell wasn't over powering, or super aromatic to me. A little bit of funk, don't know if that had to do with it being a 14. Once again the feel was the crazy thing to me and defintley stood out. It was super drinkable and if this was a beer I could have on a regular basis to have with dinner it would be amazing. I have to say that there was something tin the way Le Sarrasin finished that I like it better. This was a joy to try and hopefully will run into again. $33 for a 375 to the dome is worth it all day.",4.49
962,Ann,"The 2014 vintage, poured on-site at the Hill Farmstead taproom.",4.65
963,Ann,"Nice subtle honey without being overly sweet, and very smooth to drink. Of course its delicious but it wasn't quite the world breaker I was expecting. Definitely don't pass on it, but there are IMO much better beers to trade half your cellar away for.",4.49
964,Ann,On-site pour decanted into their branded wine glass. Dregs into a taster glass on the side.,4.84
965,Ann,"Batch 1 bottle
L: Dark orange yellow honeycomb hues with a translucent body and greeted by an amply carbonated white head
S: Clover honey upfront that is swiftly met by the oak wine barrel and rich malts
T: A huge range of flavors - this might be the most complex saison I've ever tasted: honeycomb, marmalade, tangerines, clovers, slightly tart funk, rose petals, and sweet malt that is underpinned by a healthy, well-integrated oaky chardonnay
F: Softly carbonated, medium bodied, and infinitely smooth
O: What a rare treat to enjoy this bottle! This was simply a gorgeous beer that encapsulates all of the myriad strengths of Shaun Hill and his talented team at HF. From the deeply rich look, first impressions of the nose, to the flavor profile throughout, Ann delivered on all levels for me. Of the great American saisons produced (e.g., SdF, Saison Bernice), Ann squarely sits a top on her throne as queen - this beer is untouchable, complex, and continuously rewarding throughout the session. I'm incredibly lucky to have snagged a Batch 1 bottle and it has held up incredibly well nearly half a decade later. Just an excellent beer - no other way to say it.",4.96
966,Ann,"Had it onsite at the brewery yesterday. Tons of honey in the smell but not much on the tongue, lots of white wine type flavors. Great beer but probably not one of my top favorites.",4.75
967,Ann,"From a bomber. Pours golden. Smells tart, citrusy, only hinting at funk. Taste is exceptional: tart opening, laced with hints of honey, moves into perfectly balanced funkiness. The most nuanced wild saison, and just one of the top 5 or so beers, I've ever had. I live far enough from the brewery that a visit would require an overnight stay in the area, but this one made me start thinking of how to take that trip.",4.79
968,Ann,Hill Farmsteads finest! Amazing BA Saison that is smooth with a nice barrel finish. Purchased this bottle along with many others of its caliber for a small group tasting and it was definitely one of the stars!,5
969,Ann,"Batch 3 served onsite, 375ml.",4.94
970,Ann,"Bottle at the brewery on 3/10. Delicate fermentation, honey from base beer is all but gone. Nice, mellow tartness, lots of barrel characteristic. Funky finish. Very good, but I don't think it quite deserves the hype, nor value it gets.",4.71
971,Ann,"Poured from a 375 ml bottle into a large tulip glass.
A - Wonderful clarity, steady carbonation feeds well disciplined white cap.
S - A bit of wine, mixed with hints of limestone and ash, a refined aromatic boardering on
Loire valley white.
T - Slightly tart, vinous, lemon grass, honey notes.
M - A wonderful lightly carbonated delight, the sides of the tongue react to the tartness, a wonderful coating
of slight sweet finishes the experience.
O - A superbly crafted offering, world class in every aspect.
Cheers",4.24
972,Ann,"Bach 2
What a masterful creation. Right away with a blast of crisp acidity that starts it off and stays woven throughout only mellowing just a tad for the onslaught of continious flavors I found dissipating into that signature HF soft mouthfeel. Impressive noticeable touch of wine barrel/oak, slight sweet honey, all wrapped perfectly together only to finish with some lingering tartness. Even the clarity of Ann was beautiful to look at as I savored each sip.",5
973,Ann,"One of my all-time wants. Glad to finally try -- thanks James. Had back to back with Anna and you could really see the refinement. This is the sophisticated big sister with all the sharp edges smoothed off. Lovely, vinous and soft. This is definitely worthy of its top tier status. I would likely go with Sarrasin as the best HF saison, but this is right there. Phenomenal beer.",4.75
974,Ann,"Had on tap. Very bubble clear yellow body with plenty of white bubbles, just like Anna. Smell takes the citrus, honey, botanical, and funk and gives it a seamless yet expressive backbone of oak, wine, and must. Peach, white grape, apricot, and hay are now all found in the smell and taste. Taste has more grass and botanicals in it, but impeccably balanced. Want a touch more from the barrel to match the honey more, but I am being picky. Feel is bright, delicate, elevated, wild, and slightly vinous.",4.64
975,Chemtrailmix,This beer is world class; the rye barrel alone brings dark lord to another level and then adding the layers of cinnamon. Following that with that pink peppercorn that makes this beer come alive. Theres nothing one can say about this to improve; it’s wonderful.,5
976,Chemtrailmix,This is my #1 beer. The absolute best beer I've tasted. It really turned me onto Cinnamon in my stouts. The Pink Peppercorns and cinnamon are just great together.,5

979,Chemtrailmix,"2019 consumed Dec 31, 2020. Black, small beige head, clings with some lacing. Nose of vanilla, licorice, cinnamon, slight booze. Taste leads with cinnamon, adds molasses, pepper, anise, rye boozy. Body is thick and rich, mild carbonation amplifies the rye.",4.8
980,Chemtrailmix,"WOWZA! This was the 2018 edition. Such a big boy beer. Poured like thick black motor oil. Nose was subtle, but indicative of the lusciousness to come. Will definitely have to seek out other vintages. A top tier stout for me.",4.71

984,Chemtrailmix,"Had this both fresh and ""aged"" for what it is worth, and I will say that the strength of the cinnamon itself does die down a little given time. But even with time, this is a cinnabomb, and as my favorite adjunct in a stout, take the rating with a little sense of bias. The cinnamon hides/tones down a bit of the sweetness of the overall brew, yet seems to be enhanced in flavor. A great addition to the BA DL family.",5
985,Chemtrailmix,"I've had the pleasure of enjoying Chemtrailmix three years in a row now - the bourbon barrel variant in 2017 stands out to me the most as it doesn't have the same bite and spice of rye (which I also happen to love). With a bit of age, the peppercorns mellow just slightly and the bourbon smoothly shines through. Back to back with barrel-aged Abraxas, this is still a tough one to beat. The cinnamon is far less present though, and those peppercorns have more of a bite.",4.7
986,Chemtrailmix,"Tasted from bottle. Pours black with minimal beige head. Lots of spices on aroma. Vanilla, cinnamon, bourbon. Taste is moderate to heavily sweet but not as much as regular dark lord. Nice cinnamon flavor and thankfully not a cinnamon bomb. Flavors of vanilla, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses and a hint of peppercorn on the finish. Awesome beer.",5
987,Chemtrailmix,"by far the best beer with cinnamon I've ever had. Very thick, this was Batch 1 that I had. It was really well balanced, cinnamon wasn't overpowering.",4.84
988,Chemtrailmix,"Had on tap at DLD. At a glance this looks like most other DL with a dark chocolate brown with a small head. The smell is dark chocolate and cinnamon toast crunch. When you take a sip the, the cinnamon plays perfectly with the dark chocolate and cocoa aspects of the Dark Lord. There is a slight heat and spice on the backend that lingers. Overall, this is one of the best variants of Dark Lord I've had in awhile and get why people hope to get this bottle!",4.95

Balanced aroma, chocolate the most prevalent with a hint of cinnamon. Malt has light roasted coffee aroma, rye whiskey well masked. Exciting bold taste, chocolate, cinnamon and very smooth rye whiskey worked great, very balanced offering. Nice creamy smooth mouth feel. This was a great offering, glad I had a chance to sample my first Dark Lord, this variant is an excellent offering and I look forward to trying future Dark Lord offerings.",4.38
991,Chemtrailmix,"L: Dark mocha and chestnut hues with a rust-colored head and ample lacing
S: Fresh cinnamon rolls and a trace of light roast coffee
T: Mouthful of cinnamon toast crunch cereal up front that allows a slight spice and caramelized sugar to shine through
F: Medium bodied bordering on thick
O: One of the better BA treatments of Dark Lord that makes its own statement. The rye barrel aging paired well with the hint of peppercorn spice and was smoothed out by a mellow, but distinct cinnamon note.",4.74
992,Chemtrailmix,One of the best beers of the year. This balances out perfectly the cinnamon and peppercorns with the barrel and the stout. A really really special beer that I’m very glad to have tried and have more of,4.75
993,Chemtrailmix,Multiple pours via tap DLD,4.75
994,Chemtrailmix,"This glass of used motor oil on draft has brown staining legs in spades and a lesser mocha fizz than its un-spiced, un-aged younger brothers.",4.69
995,Chemtrailmix,Had on tap at Dark Lord Day 18.,4.55
996,Chemtrailmix,Draft at DLD and on draft 2 days later at FFF.,4.99
997,Chemtrailmix,"I had FIVE of the variants on DLD and this was by far the best. The taste is a mild cinnamon toast crunch with a great balance of the peppercorns. This is a world class stout, very silky. If you can get it, get it.",4.94
998,Chemtrailmix,This beer was amazing. I sampled 6 of the Dark Lord variants including Marshmallow Handjee and French Vanilla Malitia. It was the best by far. Personally it stole the show at Dark Lord Day. It was even better than the 2017 version.,4.96
999,Chemtrailmix,"First beer I had at Dark Lord Day 2018. Sampled multiple times throughout the course of the day as well. On draft and poured into plastic cups, which were then poured into my glass. Standard Dark Lord body, not much to be said about that. Smell is a massive cinnamon, slight spicy rye, brown sugar, a bit of burnt black coffee, a bit of umami, milk chocolate- recognizably Dark Lord underneath. The flavour is a bit more muddled, but the cinnamon remains huge, from the beginning to the end, contributing that cinnamon toasted crunch up front intermingling with the DL base, and combining well with the spicy rye barrel to bring more of a spice component on the backend. Peppercorns aren't as prominent as in 2017, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is full bodied, good carbonation, smooth and slightly silky, cinnamon spice on the finish. This is on the level of BA Abraxas in terms of the cinnamon, without the green pepper from the spices. I can see this one being the variant of the year.",4.61
1000,Zombie Dust,"12 oz can 07/01/2021 , poured into a pint glass, a golden orange with a slight haze. One finger head , good lace retention. I’ll have to say, I feel like I forgot what a pale ale is supposed to taste or smell like these last 5 or so years. This one has an aroma of pine, herbal tea notes, and some orange notes. The taste is right in line, balanced with a firm malt backbone. The feel is medium, carbonation is medium. Overall, one of the better pale ales I have had in a while that didn’t pretend to be a hazy IPA.",4.35
1001,Zombie Dust,"Pretty amber color, not red, not yellow but amber. Nice slightly off white head of dense foam with great retention and smears of clingy lace.
Aroma is rich and malty initially with floral and spruce hop aromatics blending into the sweet. Some fruity notes of melon and pears waft in and out.
Balanced nose leads to balanced flavors of caramel sweetness and malt depth stitched around a firm hop bite of lemongrass and conifer forest. Hops are a little sharp and take over mid swallow but not harshly and in harmony with the distinct malt character.
Body is a bit thin, but the finish is mildly dry with some nice grain nuttiness that lingers.
3F's baby. They just make damn fine beer.",4.42
1002,Zombie Dust,"Appearance: Pours a clear, glowing, orange color like an ember from a dying campfire. A tall slightly white head. SRM of 9.0. (4.25)",4.3
1003,Zombie Dust,Howdy everybody! Good to be back! Man oh man I haven't done an actual review in a century. Hell I've barely done more than the occasional review over the past few years. Don't blame me! Blame the fact craft is dying where I'm at.,4.37
1004,Zombie Dust,"Pours a half clear orange color with a medium bodied off white colored head that laces the glass a lot as it fades. The smell is of sweet toasted malts and mix of floral and piney hops. The taste is slightly sweet up front with a mix of floral, some piney, and a hint of citrusy hops. Less of a palate smasher than expected. Medium bodied, lighter feeling than it looks, perfect amount of carbonation. Excellent Pale ale, almost to the IPA side but really well done.",4.52
1005,Zombie Dust,I first tried Zombie Dust when a friend brought it to my house about 6 years ago. His daughter went to college in Indiana and brought it home for him. Wow. This beer really turned me onto IPAs. I was lucky enough to get another 6 pack of Zombie Dust last week and I am savoring every sip. Really really great.,5
1006,Zombie Dust,"This is one of those ""must try,"" beers to my knowledge, so I figured its worth reviewing.",4.04
1007,Zombie Dust,"Can Date: 4/8/21
Palate Contaminants: none",4.36
1008,Zombie Dust,This is a near-perfect beer. It has all the hops one could need but it's welcoming and balanced. It's a great beer that can be enjoyed year-round.,4.81
1009,Zombie Dust,"12 oz can. Pours orange with tall, long-lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, orange marmalade and bready malt. Body is full and crisp. Herbal hops dominate the palate with bready malt, oranges and grapefruit in the background. Finish is long and dry. Delicious brew.",4.42
1010,Zombie Dust,"Had no idea what I was getting with this one. Loved the can, seen it was a pale ale and grabbed a six pack. Really love the comic book style artwork on the can.
Poured into a pint glass from can.
Pours an orange bronze slightly hazed appearance.
Tight white foamy head and lacing remains throughout the time drinking this one.
Smells like a hop bomb, lots going on with this one. Tropical fruits, citrus being prominent.
Peppery hops and mouthfeel upfront, smooth malts are the backbone. Hops pepper the tongue long after the sips.
Tremendous drinking beer. Tastes great, and has tons of flavor to keep you interested. Easily will crush a sixer of this without issue.
Next level pale ale here.",4.75
1011,Zombie Dust,"Served on tap in a tulip. Orangish amber in color, a solid finger of off white foam. Very nice pale ale. A bit on the hoppier side, with citrus notes - orange, mostly - just slightly over balanced on a nice malty backbone. Bright flavors. Very nice mouthfeel.",4
1012,Zombie Dust,"This APA is IPA’ish. Upfront & mid mouth it’s citrusy. Hoppy on the backend; the hoppy taste lingers for several minutes. Overall, those who love IPA’s; would love this beer. It’s very well done; good job 3 floyds!",4.4
1013,Zombie Dust,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $3.14 plus tax. Canned on 5/10/2021, so this is a bit over 7 weeks old.",4.19
1014,Zombie Dust,"About time to leave a review on this favorite. Draught pour in Columbus OH. Brassy gold color with a one finger head. Faded quickly, but left hints of lacy foam down the sides of the shaker pint. Orange, grapefruit, and something toasty on the nose. Little bit of hay as well. On the swallow i get more pink grapefruit, hint of blueberry, backed with clean, crisp malt body to provide medium mouth feel. Carbonation on this draught is properly regulated. Subtle caramel comes out as the glass warms in the 95° heat. Guess this is what we call hoppy pale ale these days; would have been (and satisfies my need for) ipa in the yesterdays",4.49
1015,Zombie Dust,"Truly tasty IPA-ish pale ale. More hoppy than some IPAs I’ve had but really tasty.
Poured from a crowler the color of iced tea, with a sparse creamy white head that leaves good lacing.
The aroma is good, definitely Citra in there, leading to the flavor of citrus and hops bitter and just a little malt to level things out.
Quite good, and happy that they finally made it to West Michigan.",4.54
1016,Zombie Dust,Pours a hazy golden color with a medium head that persists as lacing.,4.4
1017,Zombie Dust,"In a can, 6 weeks since being packaged. Some pine, maybe a hint of whiskey and leather, some citrus but not a juice bomb. The mouthfeel was pretty heavy. The overall flavor had a slight astringent note to the immediate finish. I’m not tasting the same world renowned brew that has been exalted here, but I would pay $12 for a six again, just not the $15 I originally paid.",3.69
1018,Zombie Dust,"From a 12oz can packing date 3/24/21 regular pour into a tulip glass.
This can reads 6.5%ABV.
L: Pours a hazy amber/orange with a 1"" pillowy, crunchy off-white head. Very good head retention. Good, fairly even lacing.
S: A mild complexity of ripe fruits, apricot, grapefruit, peach, light grass and a hint of bread. Not at all pungent.
T: Full-flavored citra hops, grapefruit, apricot, light pine, flowery then resin at the finish that continues with more pine, tea with lemon and grapefruit. It is fairly sweet but not dankishly intense. Hop resin lingers on.
F: It has a juicy, wet medium-bodied mouth feel, medium carbonation, lightly soft & creamy yet with a stern hop resin axis that spins hops a good distance out resulting in a long, dry finish. The hops go wide and long. It is a bit parching.
O: An excellent and flavorful DDH Pale Ale. It is a dynamic hop forward and resinous ale. Very juicy to dry.",3.99
1019,Zombie Dust,12 ounce can poured into a can glass.,4.55
1020,Zombie Dust,Poured into my tulip this beer is a cloudy golden amber with a tall creamy off white head. Great retention and tons of lace. Great looking beer.,4.18
1021,Zombie Dust,Pours amber with an off white head.,4.29
1022,Zombie Dust,"Intensely hoppy American Pale Ale with a well-rounded bitterness that appeals to the American IPA fan that I am.
Look: pale orangey amber.
Smell: although ''only'' 6%ABV a little alcohol in the nose.
Taste / Feel: smooth and fresh, with subdued malt.
Overall, an exceptional American Pale Ale. But why do they limit purchase to 2×12 ounces bottles in Milwaukee liquor stores? (as of Sep.2017).
◇ May 2020 update:
Draft at the D&V, Shorewood - WI.
I confirm my review. No whiff of alcohol in the smell. Taste is really ""breathtaking"". A bouquet of hoppy flavors... and dry, bitterness that carries me away. ♡♡♡",4.94
1023,Zombie Dust,This is an undead pale ale style beer (lol) with 62 IBUs and 6.5% ABV. I read the reviews on BeerAdvocate before buying it and was really impressed with its 100 and world class rating! I checked the canned-on date and found it was only 3 weeks old! I poured into a Teku glass (that my brother got me!) to enhance the aroma with the laser-etched nucleation sites on the bottom.,4.91

1025,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,2018 Vintage,4.08
1026,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Well my wife thinks this beer is too big for me to finish in one sitting. She's upset this is 25 oz and she thinks i should only be drinking a bomber a night, which is 22 oz. So this experience begins with stress and tension. And a couple eye rolls. I purchased this from a private seller for $40, which is probably way too much to pay but i can't get this around here in Ohio, and I'd heard so much about this beer i had to try it. So every whale has its price i suppose. Glad to be trying a beer from Tampa as I've been watching some interviews toady with Shock G, AKA Humpty Hump, about the history of hip hop, and he's from Tampa. Poured up deep dark brown with a darkly tan one inch head, a shade darker than khaki. It quickly dissipated into a floating ring around the glass. To be honest, this smells like wet metal, iron, blood. And a little chocolate, dark berry, and thick dark sugary things like molasses. I'm actually getting a lot of plum from this taste, plum and raisin and dates. More plum than ""Plum Tuckered out"" by Hoppin Frog. Very sweet, heavy and dark. A little burned tasting. Slight cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of vanilla on the back end. Although the description says there's some Scoville units on this one, I can't detect any spiciness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate effervescence. Overall, it is very good, but i am not as thoroughly impressed as i expected to be. This is rated 100 on this website, and i think it tastes really good, but I'm not going to be that generous, as i don't think there's anything particularly unique about the brew. Maybe i'm just sullied by my wife's remarks and hope she just goes in and smokes a big bowl so she can get high and forget about the fact i'm drinking this whole thing tonight. So much for $40. Maybe better luck next time.",3.75
1027,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Look - fantastic black and thick with a great lasting tan head and rimming
Smell - you can really smell it all. First notes of smell is the cinnamon and roasted malts with a slight chili pepper followed by cocoa and vanilla
Taste - cinnamon and pepper with a slight sweet vanilla and a little cocoa
Feel - medium body light carb with a slight cream
Overall - tasty Mexican stout",4.34
1028,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Had this in August, then the 2016 version, + have tasted a few vintages before. Incredible solid imperial stout from the Floridian masters here! Super RIS",4.52
1029,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,Abyss black body; fizzy carbonation percolating up through the depths; initial decent head yet it quickly dissipates to a thin fizzy ring dancing around the circumference of the glass. Outstanding aroma; tropical fruit sweetness with a rich bitter chocolate element; chili peppers. The taste multiplies the smell sensations; chili pepper spiciness with cinnamon overtones; cocoa and bitter chocolate; star anise. Heavy body; slick and oily on the palate; warm with chili heat and boozy warmth; sticky residual sugars coat the palate and offset the warmth notes with a sweet mouthfeel quality.,4.62
1030,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2020 release. Received from @roguer. Poured into a Cigar City tulip glass. It pours almost jet black with a creamy, medium mocha-colored head and lacing that dissipated quickly. Its nose features roasted malt, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, freshly-brewed coffee, tobacco smoke, dark fruit, peppers, and subtle but distinct bourbon. The flavor is ridiculous! It opens with cocoa and coffee, along with mellow peppers, black cherry, and cinnamon. All the flavors are delicate and they blend beautifully. The bourbon notes are subtle and enhance the other flavors. It's so easy to drink. The mouth feel is creamy and remarkably lite for 10.2% . Overall, Hunahpu's is everything I thought it would be - and more. It's delicious and perfect either to pair with a hearty meal or for casual drinking. I'm grateful to finally drink this white whale.",4.54
1031,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"To me this will always be the beer that started it all. Delicious, dark cherry and cinnamon taste. Perfect carbonation and mouthfeel. Tried it with some older folks who never had a craft beer before and they were sold!",4.26
1032,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,L: Pours a brown-black with a perfect deep mahogany head which does not dissipate too quickly.,4.12
1033,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Poured into a 20 oz giant tulip glass bottled 3/13/2020. Pours midnight black in the dead of a cloudy Winters evening, with a massive 2 plus finger mocha head that leaves a few thin streaks of lace, as it slowly settles into a thin layer of mocha bubbles. 4.75.",4.75
1034,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a dense and slightly rocky two fingers of dark tan head which retains well and leaves minimal lacing
S: Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, hints of peppers, and some vanilla.
T: Taste is sweet vanilla up front with cinnamon, pepper heat, chocolate, and coffee. Nice roasted malts as well, hint of charred wood and burnt sugar too. On the swallow there's more sweet vanilla, cinnamon, peppers, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and charred wood.
M: This beer is thick and velvety on the palate. Carbonation is low but adequate for the style while the beer has a drying finish due to the ABV.
O: Overall this beer is fantastic. Great flavors and a killer amount of complexity make this a very enjoyable beer to drink. I've been sitting on this one for a bit but it doesn't seem to have fallen off at all. Really nice balance of flavors and very well integrated. This is definitely a beer you need to try if you like heavily adjuncted stouts that aren't straight diabetes in a bottle.",4.75
1035,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,Amazing diverse stout. Was able to get some of the original and variants last April during Hunahpu event. Excellent beer. Going to Tampa 6/26 and will get some more!,4.75
1036,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,Purchased 3 bottles online. Typical stout with peppers. Good but not all that. Not sure if I would pay as much as I did in order to store some in the cellar,4.04
1037,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2019 version on draft at Cigar City. Poured a black body with minimal khaki head and this tiny khaki lace ring that stuck around. The aroma comes across as spicy, the cinnamon and chilies grabbing the nose, with minor chocolate sweetness underneath the spice. Smooth, silky, has some sticky sweetness despite how easy it is to drink. Chili and cinnamon balance with chocolate and vanilla, just enough booze for a complementary finish, and even mild notes of dark fruits like figs (not so much plum). Just a bit of everything in this beer and it is flavorful and so easy to drink.",4.18
1038,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,2017 Bomber. Thanks Adam and Jay! Had a great time and a great trade.,4.44
1039,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. 2017 edition,4.74
1040,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Pours black with a finger of caramel-colored foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is roasty and dark, with cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate, cocoa nibs, toffee and molasses creating the bulk of the nose. Roasty and toasty malts are supportive and abundant. Flavor profile is huge, hitting notes of cinnamon, cardoman, nutmeg, molasses, toffee, caramel, dark fruits, coffee, chocolate and cocoa nibs. Big sugary notes, but they are balanced out by roasty and toasty malts. Mouth feel is thick and full, with a modest level of graininess. Overall, deep and expressive with loads of flavor. Lovely stout!",4.63
1041,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Slightly overrated IMO. This stout is on the high end of the cinnamon war, so if that's your thing - you must try it. No too sweet, I'll give it that. Otherwise I've found many more balanced brews in the category, such as Coffee Cinnamon Bourbon Abominable by Fremont. Hunahpu is worthy of a try and of forming your own opinion, but you may also not find it up to the hype.",4.35
1042,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,2016 vintage (released 3/12/16); drank 5/21/16 @ Yuss Haus Mach II.,4.25
1043,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Everything great in an imperial stout, deep brown to black, creamy tan foam. And a subtle hint of spices and chili peppers. A great example of how to add a lot of flavor and spice to a beer and not ruin it.",4.38
1044,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Would I buy this again? Yes, but only one bottle cellared at a time. Do t see any reason to cellar for extended period of time or collect for verticle.",4.5
1045,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,2-1-19: 2017 version from bottle at home. The heat with this one is mild. I can definitely taste the cinnamon. This seems a bit thin. For me the hype doesn't quite match the taste. Maybe I need to try this fresher.,3.45
1046,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"I finally got to try this whale after a trade. I thought it was similar to Abraxas. I had a 2017, and may have bunkered it too long with the flavors becoming much more mild than other reviewers indicate.",4.27
1047,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,I finally landed this whale. I have wanted to drink this beer for the last five years. I am looking forward to this review. I popped the top off and a hiss emitted. The beer is 52 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The beer just glugged out of the bottle as I poured it into the glass. This thick beer produced a two finger dark brown head. The retention on the head is phenomenal. The head dissipated slowly and left no lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 38 nearly black. The beer is opaque.,4.87
1048,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Fascinating and very complex beer! The chilis come through, but are not overpowering. This is a sipping beer, and I'm glad I had a small pour at the brewery. Great stuff--I've been to Cigar City a number of times, but this is the first time I've seen Hunahpu's on tap. Hooray!",4.49
1049,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,Very pretty looking. Pitch brown in all the right ways. Love the little lacing patches that linger after each drink. Lots of cinnamon on the nose to go with dark almost leathery chocolate. Mexican heat heat too - brightens up the same notes from the nose and adds some notes of chiles.,4.37
1050,Doubleganger,"can dated 9/1/21 yes freshness matters I think 2 weeks is awesome & 3 weeks the limit., The beer just tastes different after.",4.74
1051,Doubleganger,"Average pour fills two-thirds of a pint glass with deep tan foam, takes some time to settle down enough to take a sip, curiously not much stick to the lacing. The liquid basically looks like you took a glass of apricot juice and stuck in the freezer, impenetrable and immobile. The nose packs a solid punch of dank herbaceousness, roofing tar, pine sap and thick, sticky pineapple, mango, kiwi with some melon and peach in reserve, not teasing out any citrus nor florality. Full-bodied, without the help of the weakish carbonation manages nonetheless to develop nice momentum across the palate. In turn while it's juicy and ""damp"" at first there is a pleasing elevation in dryness at the end. Notes of brioche and challah bread pile on the mango, papaya, pineapple, kiwi fruit, intense fruit flavors. Vanilla ice cream touch pops up now and then. Still barely registering any citrus, pink grapefruit if anything. On the whole it tastes awfully like a confection dessert. Scores points for sheer bombast but I'd be hard pressed to see anyone easily put back two cans of it in a row, it's that tiring. (Canned 7/30/21)",4.33
1052,Doubleganger,"Super hazy yellow-orange color with a thick white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of sweet citrus and some piney hop aromas in there as well. Tastes of melony and citrusy hops, slight hint of pine at the very backend of it. Feels silky, smooth, perfect amount of carbonation. Overall an excellent beer!",4.44
1053,Doubleganger,"Alter Ego turned up to 11. I actually like the more subtle characteristics of Alter Ego's flavors, but if you're looking for a juicy, intense DIPA, look no further! It's what TH does best!",4.64

1057,Doubleganger,"Pours a medium golden color, very hazy. Ample foamy white head. Dank hoppy aroma, guava and mango. Balanced hop flavor, dank with gentle bitterness that fades. Citrusy with mango and tropical fruit flavors. Creamy texture, fairly thick and viscous. Overall a fantastic DIPA.",4.5
1058,Doubleganger,Poured from a can (02Apr2021) into a Tree House teku #properglassware,4.81
1059,Doubleganger,"Pours an opaque yellow/light orange with a big pillowy white head. Leaves good lacing. Smell is slighly sweet tropical and stone fruit (reminds me of smelling dried mango and peach) and dank hops. Great full bodied mouthfeel; chewy and juicy. Medium carbonation and smooth. Taste is well balanced; also tropical and stone fruit sweetness and floral bitterness. Only a very slight warming booziness. Another solid Tree House offering, but not one in the upper echelon of theirs that I would choose if I had my personal pick.",4.34
1060,Doubleganger,"Wow. Just wow. I figure this has to be one of the first New England IPAs judging by the entry date. Canned 1/27. So cloudy I cannot see through it. Very similar in appearance to orange juice. Fluffy head that dissipates but leaves thick long lasting lacing. Citrusy and dank hop scents that punched me in the nose, and I liked it. Taste is a battle of titans-huge citrusy flavors duke it out with dank bitterness and it’s a fight worth being in the middle of. Big bodied, mouth watering, subtle booziness, mouth filling, extremely sippable. First of the long time wants from the box of Tree House I got this week, and I am NOT disappointed in the slightest. Damn great beer.",4.91
1061,Doubleganger,"Decanted from a 16 oz (453 ml) can into a Tree House snifter; canned 11/25/20, code CHECK YOUR MIRRORS.
A: Pours a hazy dark golden orange with one to two finger, lemon chiffon head, solid retention, and rings and rings of lacing.
S: Aromas are largely fruity, orange, grapefruit, peach, and mango, superimposed on a caramel and honey backbone.
T: Semisweet. The flavors largely follow the nose, but with the addition of strong grapefruit zest at first and stronger and stronger malt presence as it warms. Very creamy with strong but very well balanced bitterness. Caramel flavor becomes more pronounced as it warms, almost resembling a caramel drop.
M: Medium bodied with strong carbonation. Creamy, full mouthfeel.
O: Like Doppelganger, a superbly fruity DIPA. Flavor profile complex and evolves from fruit to malt predominant. Was really worth trying.",4.7

S: mango papaya tropical dominant.
T: Mango, stonefruit, grapefruit juice at the end to round it out. A bit of vanilla/caramel. No alcohol taste. Well maybe a tiny bit as it warms, not unpleasant.
F: Standard treehouse juicy done right. Maybe the ghost of a hop burn or spiciness.
Overall: a great dipa from treehouse. Has the tropical juiciness with enough bite and carbonation to balance it out.",4.47
1070,Doubleganger,"Poured a light peach hazy color. No translucence. Aroma pretty heavy with citrus creamsicle. It’s all that I can pick up, but wow, delightful. Upon tasting, it’s just as the same; orange creamsicle, touch of peach, and vanilla. Not complex but a very easy drinking fruit desert! Mouthfeel very creamy and smooth. A little hop bite at the end.

Strong garlic, acidic fruits hops. Brief sweetness before it becomes earthy and garlicky bordering on oniony. Earthy and sharp finish. Medium heavy, intense, and a little slow to drink. I love hops like this, but this is quite intense. A bit too sharp for my tastes, but it's not bad.",3.38

1074,Doubleganger,"Pours opaque orange with a frothy white head on top. Good lacing and retention. The smell isn’t over the top but had some nice tropical notes to it along with some subtle dank aromas going on. The taste has a sweet orange-like melon candy with a bitter creamy finish.

1081,Double Citra®,"On draft at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA. Holds head extremely long, with a lighter golden – yellow color underneath. Lovely fresh hit in nose, but with a surprising dryness. Smooth, balanced, and long, with good weight, which I don’t always get from Citra hops. Finishes with layers in depth, dry rather than sweet. Surprisingly elegant and rich without being heavy.",4.35
1082,Double Citra®,Can: Poured a hazy blonde color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of fresh citrusy notes with nice floral hoppy undertones and light subtle residual sugar notes. Taste is also a mix of huge juicy citrusy hoppy notes with some floral undertones and some residual sugar notes. Body is full with good carbonation. Solid IIPA with nice juicy notes.,4.41
1083,Double Citra®,Light golden colored and exceptionally hazy. There’s a half inch of creamy dishwater white on top. The aroma is of mandarin orange. I’m tasting sharply bitter mandarin orange that leaves a long deep burn to the tongue and lingers long after you swallow it.,4.35
1084,Double Citra®,Pours out hazy yellow orange. Color of pineapple juice. Small ring of carbonation.,4.39
1085,Double Citra®,Appearance: poured a non-translucent cloudy peach color beer. Finished with a 1 inch head that disappeared quickly.,4.49
1086,Double Citra®,"12oz can purchased at the brewery. Pours a hazy dirty orange with an inch of head. Moderate amount of lacing. Lots of citra hops in the nose.

Some alcohol heat. Medium body with a dry mouthfeel.",4.27

1088,Double Citra®,"Oh my.
I was lucky enough to enjoy a can of HF Double Citra over Labor Day weekend in New Hampshire. A friend had recently purchased at HF. I apologize because I neglected to check the canning date.
Just incredible. I haven't been ""wow'd"" by many DIPAs of late, but this knocked my socks off.
Poured from a 12oz can into a snifter. Full on hazy orange (a bit darker orange than OJ). Creamy white head.
Smell of ripe stone fruit, mango, with solid underlying dankness (weed). Out of this world.
Taste was delicious, with notes of ripe peach, candied orange, dried apricot, and a nice dank resiny finish.
Mouth feel was soft, rich, and full, with perfect medium carbonation, fully enveloping the taste buds. Mouth-watering goodness.
Quite possibly the best DIPA and best beer I have ever had, definitely in Top 5. Juicy Dank Lively Complex Goodness! Hop Candy! 100+/100.",5
1089,Double Citra®,"More orange than golden pour, creamy bright white head, and the smell! Pop the top and it's like someone in the room just sliced a grapefruit. We know we're dealing with a single hop beer, and the taste, while consistent and one note, still takes you on a journey. The Citra comes through loud and clear, and then at a point in the midtaste, that taste kind of ramps up to a new level. And let's not forget that long, luxurious aftertaste. Brilliantly crafted.",4.5
1090,Double Citra®,"Double Citra pours a milky and creamy orange color with a complex white cap on top that lingers leaving some impressive lacing. The smell is a true NE style DIPA, big and juicy on the nose with layer upon layer of Citra hops bringing out the citrus and tropical fruits including mango, grapefruit, peach and a hint of melon with some earthy tones and an herb quality. The taste, this is closest I've come to a perfect beer. Wow! This Double Citra tastes amazing, very soft and smooth over the palette with a light body that brings out orange, tangerine, grapefruit and some melon sweetness with a subdued bitterness.",4.59
1091,Double Citra®,"Pours an opaque orange with two fingers of frothy, dense white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is a blast of tangerine, papaya, lemon and mandarin oranges. Grassy hops and a light bready yeast at the back rounds out the aroma. Flavor profile is tangerine, papaya, mango, lemon, mandarin oranges, and bready malts create a soothing hypnotic experience. Balance is sublime, never coming off overly sweet or bitter. Mouth feel has a consistent siltiness to it with a medium-thick consistency that adds power to each sip. Overall, a delectable brew with big tropical fruit notes, and a well-refined balance.",4.71
1092,Double Citra®,Phenomenal. Best HF IPA I've had.,4.66

1097,Double Citra®,Appearance is a nice amber with a slight white head. Aroma is a strong citrus with a tough of hops. The taste is also a fairly strong citrus with a touch of hops.,4.49
1098,Double Citra®,Appearance - Pours cloudy yellow with nice thin white cap that settles to a thick ring around the glass. Nice sheets of lacing down the glass.,4.85

1105,Atrial Rubicite,"Looks gorgeous in color and smell. I saved this for Xmas night so my expectations were high and they’ve been met. Lots of raspberries on the tongue. More so than any Belgian lambics that I’ve had (not that I’ve had all that many.) it’s tart but not overwhelmingly so. More so than someone who doesn’t know sours or lambics would normally like though. I feel like it’s missing the special bite of my favorite 3 Fonteinen lambics, but I don’t know what makes that flavor pop in my mouth. This is still world class and I’ll be seeking out more.",4.52
1106,Atrial Rubicite,"This one pours a dark reddish color - jammy as all get out - with a small head, and not much lacing.",4.84

1108,Atrial Rubicite,"It took a lot to get one of these so I was anxious when I popped the top. I was happy to be greeted by a a funky raspberry aroma. From the smell, I thought it would be sweet, but it was pleasantly dry. What a great beer! My only regret was that I drank it too fast- so damn tasty. A trip to Austin is in order.",4.87
1109,Atrial Rubicite,"Beautiful deep read with a minimal Ruby lacing around the circumference of the glass. Nose is pure Raspberry and some the jester King culture, very dry. The nose made me concerned that if was going to be pure acid. Suprised that it was a dry raspberry flavor with a subtleness of wild microflora. Feel is initially effervescent on the tounge and then quickly dissipates. Overall excellent, think it can slightly more carbed",4.45
1110,Atrial Rubicite,"L: Deep Ruby in Color. Thin pink head that dissipates quickly
S: Straight Raspberry Jam
T: You get the raspberry jam that the nose presents, but it is met with a lot of acidity. It isn't unpleasant though. A slight amount of oak at the end.
F: Medium body with a fairly high carb level
O: This beer is very good. It could be slightly less tart, but it has enough raspberry jam to back it up. Overall, this is quite nice.",4.51
1111,Atrial Rubicite,"Not my favorite style but I still enjoyable. Pours ruby red with dark pink head. Smells of tart raspberries. Taste is sour raspberries, very sour to my taste but classic to style. Bubbly and refreshing.",4
1112,Atrial Rubicite,Raspberry...funkiness....leathery...dusty....tart...,4.65
1113,Atrial Rubicite,"Batch 8 (June 2018), poured into a JK SPON tulip. The look is amazing; deep ruby, almost mistakable for a Bordeaux. Moderate carbonation that dissipates very quickly. The nose is full of jammy raspberry and signature JK funk; moderately musty, dusty, and woody. Palate is mildly tart and acetic, with plenty of jammy raspberry, oak, and some yogurt (especially on the finish); getting close to a fruited lambic in style. Very enjoyable.",4.49
1114,Atrial Rubicite,"Batch 8 poured in Casey teku. Pours a bright vibrant clear ruby red with a soft whispy pink head. Nose has that mellow Greek yogurt smell going on with a blast of tart and sweet raspberries and cherries. First sip is a little of everything. Tart, mellow funk, musty, jammy! I love the depth and intensity of the raspberries. It’s definitely jam like, perfect tart to sweet ratio as far as the berries go. Nice mellow wet oak throughout that really ties it together. Musty cellar like quality and mild yogurt funk all come together to make this beer what it is. As it warms the raspberries shine even more and tartness builds but this beer is equally interesting on both the colder and warmer side. Body is medium to Jammy at times. Tart funky dry finish at the end that invites another swig to wet the mouth and start the process all over again.",4.53
1115,Atrial Rubicite,"What's not to like here? Pours a burgundy with a finger of pink head. Smell is fresh, sweet yet slightly tart raspberry. A hint of oak.
Taste follows with tart raspberry, a bit of barrel, some funk
Medium bodied with dry finish.
Overall an excellent fruited sour. Beyond tart but doesn't take the enamel off of your teeth sourness.",4.81
1116,Atrial Rubicite,"09/2014 - Incredible raspberry and cherry aromas with some oaky, yeast coming through; tart, acidic, fruity, flavorful body; wee thin of a body, but it's superb overall!",4.48
1117,Atrial Rubicite,"I've been chasing down a bottle of Atrial for a few months now - I missed it at the Festival of Wood and Barrel Aged Beers (FOBAB) in November of 2017 (kicked in the VIP session), and I've had a couple of trades fall through. And then, suddenly, I had TWO trades go through within a week of each other! Exciting.",4.91
1118,Atrial Rubicite,"On tap at Hops and Pie. Extremely purple with a pink head, vibrant colors. Smells like a jar of raspberry preserves, very jammy and fruity. Sweetness as well. Flavor was mostly raspberry preserves and a slight sourness. I understand now why people might seek out Jester King.",4.29
1119,Atrial Rubicite,Poured from a mini bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip. Love the artwork,4.58
1120,Atrial Rubicite,"2015 bottle (Blend 5) - deep lipstick red with a thin white/redish head that quickly goes away. Smell is heavy raspberry with a little funk. Was somewhat let down by the lack of farmhouse funk smell. Flavor follows. Overall a superb beer, just may have aged a touch too long. At nearly three years old, I think this maybe aged 4-6 mnoths too long.",4.88
1121,Atrial Rubicite,"Batch from June of 2017. Pours a dark rich red/purple with some carbonation. Smell is sweet pungent raspberry and earthy. Taste is tart, very refreshing, unabashedly raspberry. Dances the line between a fruity juice and a sour beer. Smooth and easy to drink. Really enjoyed it.",4.52
1122,Atrial Rubicite,"Appearance was darker than expected but everything else was just as advertised. It has plenty of raspberry flavor, but its more than a juice bomb. Subtle funk, dryness, and raspberry seeds make it a very enjoyable treat.",4.34
1123,Atrial Rubicite,This was absolutely incredible. Probably the best sour I've ever had. So much raspberry across the whole beer. This feels pretty much like having raspberry juice.,4.98

1129,V.S.O.J.,"One of the best barrel-aged barleywines and as a bonus, it's somewhat easily available in the Chicago area. Big bold flavors at every turn. Huge boozy nose. Much smoother finish than the smell would indicate. An excellent entry into the #BIL catalog.",4.67
1130,V.S.O.J.,"Commonly regarded as the best barrel-aged English barleywine in the U.S., hopes are extremely high. Aroma is a tad overwhelmed by the high ABV, as I’m finding it difficult to find complex characteristics through the alcohol burn. Pull the glass away a bit, and you can pick up aromas of sweet, caramel malts, coconut and vanilla truffles.",4.8
1131,V.S.O.J.,This is the 2021 version. I was lucky enough to grab a 4 pack so this is out of the can. Made this one last and it was almost like drinking two different beers. At first it was very oaky with some vanilla and more boozy. As it warmed up you could taste a little dark fruit and the vanilla became stronger. It also didn't taste as sweet as it got warmer. The whole drinking experience was an exercise in patience as i wanted to chug all 12 oz. But I'm glad I took my time and savored this masterpiece. Revolution just keeps one upping themselves with every release and I'm totally hooked.,4.85

1133,V.S.O.J.,"(2021) Looks like a day-old Dr. Pepper that’s gone flat but with a whift of bubbles on the rim and slight random streaks of white foam on the surface. Smells like faint brandy. The taste is where this stands out and distinguishes itself from other barleywines. Very rich dark fruits and barleywine and bourbon barrel. Charred oak, sweet fig, tobacco, vanilla, raisin, sweet toffee, dates. No off-putting flavors or alcohol characteristics of bad barley wines. Fantastically thick viscosity compliments the taste. This is a ten out of ten for the style. Nearly perfect blending of beer and alcohol.",4.23
1134,V.S.O.J.,"This beer perfectly rides the line between sweet caramel tones and bourbon oak. It is a little thinner than some of the heavy hitter barleywines like a deal with the devil, but it more than makes up for it with the pronounced barrel character. You can taste the aging process.",4.71

Lots of fig, raisin and prune and a hint of tobacco. Flavor was everything I detected in the aroma. Tons of fig, raisin and prune...lots of bourbon and oak. Very rich. Feel was medium bodied.

Nose: A lot of chocolate, like a brownies, small hint of booze, very oaky. You can tell this is complex just by the nose and you just want to take the time to smell it enough but you just can't stop.
Taste as intended is astonishing, chocolate all over the place, light bitterness, light to medium sweetness, oak.

Can stamped 02/24/20
Straw colored, turbid, with a pillowy white head that pushes damn near 3 fingers in height. Slowly recedes to a consistent, persistent finger high for the next 3-4 minutes. Some sticky lacing.
Aroma bursts with an initial onslaught of zesty citrus: grapefruit, orange, lemon zest. But there's a honey-tinged grainy note too, akin to wet oats and buckwheat. I could smell this all day.
Taste, again citrus forward but, more complex.m There's subtle hints of peach, cantaloupe, lemongrass, understated nods to onion and herbal spice that quickly retreat and leave a melange of crackery malt and a lingering grass-tinged bitterness.
Mouthfeel is , well Hill Farmstead. I truly feel like the water is a key characteristic, their terroir. This one is a bit fluffy, and there is a mineral note that is divine. Carbonation is there throughout, but not prominent.

The taste is pineapple, lime, grapefruit and peach. A bit more citrus bitterness towards the end. Spicy/herbal hop finish. Malts come out at the end. Dry mouthfeel with a medium body.

1189,Double Galaxy,Picked up a 6 pack of this at the source in late October. What a fun day that was.,4.23

1195,Double Galaxy,"Canned 08/13/19 Drink by 09/24/19 “D.Galaxy”
Can a Galaxy hop be presented in a more impressive manner? I think not. I had forgotten how incredible this varietal can be. Or is it the talent of HF that can showcase a single ingredient in such a way with a delicious base recipe. Regardless, it’s pungent, grassy, dank, vegetal, earthy, and drinkable beyond belief. Sticky and resinous in the finish and feel with plenty of fruit as well. What a beer.",4.66
1196,Double Galaxy,"Almost a typical NEIPA look but nit as murky. Aroma is delicious citrus, maybe a touch of juniper or pine, some dough. Juicy flavor, not harsh at all, drinkability is scary. My takeaway from Hill Farmstead IPA's after not having them for three years is that they are more refined and subtle than some of the stuff from Treehouse or Trillium. They capture all the right notes but they are soft and refined. I didn't think I liked Galaxy hops but this is high quality beer.",4.24

Mild bitterness on the follow.
Heavy lacing on the brandy snifter.",4.83
1198,Double Galaxy,"Beautiful orange pour with a nice finger's thickness of white, creamy head. Smells terrific - lots of orange-y citrus notes. Taste is super clean with a ton of citrus, some resiny green notes, a bit of bitterness in the finish. Just excellent. Really drinkable, impossible to discern the 8% ABV. Would love to crush these by a fire.",4.39
1199,Double Galaxy,"Soft gold, foamy head. Aroma has underripe melon, faint lemon, musty hop. Palate is pretty balanced, not super juicy, more earthy fruit flavors like stone fruit, maybe a little apricot, with some grassy earthy hops. Medium bitterness",4.37
1200,Framboise Du Fermier,"750 ml bottle today. Poured a deep and dark ruby color. Beautiful beer in the glass. Instant aroma of raspberries. Very fragrant. Smells fruity and tart. Flavor was full of raspberry with some acidity and a hint of vinegar. A real treat though. Great body for the style. Good carb too. Overall, outstanding iteration of a fruited saison. Took a long time for me to track this one down and would do it again.",4.6

1202,Framboise Du Fermier,"Pouted from a 750 mL bottle. The color is very pretty dark red hazy color. The aroma is a bit of funk with a big explosion of raspberry, love it. The taste follows the smell with the typical SP acidity and a big raspberry flavor, super jammy. Its an awesome beer and tasty nonetheless.",5
1203,Framboise Du Fermier,"First of all, the smell. Wow! Hits your nose and you don’t want to pour it, drink it out of the bottle! My friend I’m drinking it with said it tastes like a raspberry Flintstones vitamin. It’s a great one no doubt!",4.75
1204,Framboise Du Fermier,Hazy strawberry color with thin lacing. Tart raspberry funk on the nose. Taste is tart funk raspberry with alot of puckering. The sourness coats the mouth to the point where you have to scrape your tongue. Very funky and very tart.,4.15
1205,Framboise Du Fermier,"Side Project makes wonderful beer and this is a good one; it is not a 100 point beer. The nose, balance and flavor profiles are all ""fine."" Yes, that's it - just fine. It is somewhat balanced but also light on fruit and a bit thin. Yet, very pleasant, inviting and drinkable.",4

F: Superbly even and smooth mouthfeel with a crisp saison dryness on the finish
O: Been sitting on this one for awhile and finally popped it open on a 90 degree afternoon. Just a stunning pour followed by a robust jammy goodness. Really well done and perfect for a late summer day.",4.75
1210,Framboise Du Fermier,"WAY too damn sour, puckering to say the least. Raspberries are normally one of my personal favorites added to a sour but this is utterly acidic and rough. Cant say I'd go after this again. not my jam and the side project label is what is carrying this in my opinion.",3.67
1211,Framboise Du Fermier,"while the side project wild beers have certainly been tending more acidic over the least year or so, in some instances, i think the higher acidity really works, and this is a great example of that. another one of the fruited fermier beers, up there with my favorites in the series, the plum, the cherry, and the blueberry, and i think the clean sourness that ramps up towards the end is part of what makes it. there is a lot of fruit in here, and a serious jammy sweetness is contributed by the raspberries, so the sour almost works to enhance and balance it, and with all the oak this has on it, along with the lemony funk, the drying cereal grain base, and the obvious maturity, its a complex and balanced brew that delivers what it seems to promise. i am not sure if this was aged in wine barrels or not, but it sure seems like it was, some notes of red and black currant in here, a tart cherry thing, and even a light strawberry thing, they all make it seem vinous to me, so does all the tannins in here. i even get trace watermelon flesh, juicy fruit gum, and red wine vinegar. suffice it to say there is quite a bit of depth to this. the fruit is insanely natural, really forward, and expressed beautifully through this base saison. almost as intense as i remember them being in the raspe, although i know this has to be less per barrel right? i also like it being a little stronger here, seems to slow me down, allow it to warm and open, and cut some of the flavor intensity with a little palate clearing alcohol. brilliant stuff, good carbonation too, especially compared to a few of the others in the series. the beat goes on for side project!",4.46
1212,Framboise Du Fermier,Bottle pour.,4.34
1213,Framboise Du Fermier,"Wow the smell on this beer is just heavenly. Full of fresh raspberries, full of tartness and sweetness. Basically liquid raspberry in pure sour saison form. Has all of the complex and beautifully balanced flavors and feel from the original, but now has a fresh fruit to star up front. Mouthfeel finish did feel a little grainy and acidic on the end, but I'm just nitpicking at this point.",4.73
1214,Framboise Du Fermier,"B2 shared on 8-19-18(Fermier Day). Pours on the lighter shade of ruby(it was the lightest shade compared with Quetsche, Kriek, and Bluet). Nice raspberry funk on the nose. An initial raspberry flavor hits the palate, but for some strange reason quickly fades as my acidic ""woo"" reaction kicks in. I've read so many reviews here with the same ""jam/jammy"" comments, and I was very disappointed when I finally got to try this coveted brew, because those 2 words are far from the truth. Jam is sweet, something you put on bread(or crackers if you really want to be Mr. Fancy Pants). This beer is strongly acidic, dare I say overly so.",4.22

1216,Framboise Du Fermier,"Easily the best I've ever had from Side Project. It's fantastic, and the raspberries shine through perfectly. It also strikes a great balance between its tartness and its drinkability.",4.77
1217,Framboise Du Fermier,Some of Side Projects finest! Had this alongside a 2011 Cantillon LPF and this was better. Purchased this bottle along with many others of its caliber for a small group tasting and it was definitely one of the stars!,4.96
1218,Framboise Du Fermier,"Can't help but notice the beautiful color of this brew first. A bright red, almost pink hue w excellent carb bubbles dancing the drunken dance they do. I love atrial, and it's natural to compare the 2 brews, but this can go toe to toe with it most certainly! Be prepared for that tart doe, loved how it felt.",4.77
1219,Framboise Du Fermier,"Shared from a 750 at the cellar. A Beautiful beer with strong fruit nose, a wonderful balance of tartness. As it warms up it gets better. Reminded me of my Aunt Edna jarring her own jelly in the kitchen when I was a kid. Phenomenal.",4.8
1220,Framboise Du Fermier,"Tasted this as part of a fruited Fermier set. The nose promised an acidic affair, but was quite soft upon tasting. This was my second favorite fruited Fermier to the Abricot. A really nice beer, but perhaps its rarity is driving up ratings a bit.",4.58
1221,Framboise Du Fermier,"The nose on this was absolutely incredible. Huge punch in your face of raspberries, raspberries, and yup, more raspberries. Cold it was more raspberry juice, the saison side only really shined as it warmed up. I really think though that fruited wild ale, like Atrial, is better than fruited saison. Beautiful beer, but I still prefer Saison du Fermier over this.",4.81
1222,Framboise Du Fermier,"750 B1. Huge thanks to Matt for opening this one. Incredible raspberry nose. Amazing. Taste is mildly sour for a SP, raspberry and lemon. Very balanced. No harsh acidity. Truly amazing stuff.",4.58
1223,Framboise Du Fermier,"Super intense raspberries on the nose and taste. Just explodes all over the palate. As if the raspberries weren't enough, the carbonation is lively and the prickly sensation is like pop rocks candy on the tongue. Maybe get some subtle hints of lemon and oak, but the sour raspberry jam overwhelms everything else. This was quite the experience, but wouldn't want to drink a lot of it.",4.5
1224,Framboise Du Fermier,"The perfect beer. Don't drink too cold! Once it warms up / reaches ~50F it opens up and balances perfectly. Tons and tons of fruit in the nose. Super jammy, starts as a sour, when warmed opens up as a saison. Fantastic brew.",5

It is a fudge vanilla cake like flavor. The depth of the flavor was incredible. I arrived at 11:30 and took tell two to finish the flight. As this warmed and oxidized the aroma subsided as expected but the flavor just developed more chocolate cake. Outstanding and worth the trip to finally taste this. I had Morning Delight and Term Oil Maple Cakes in the same flight plus the two Latte's. Best flight of my life.

1253,Anabasis,"i have long been trying to track this one down, and i am stoked to finally have gotten the chance to enjoy it, blend three, an awfully fine example of the style, adjunct free if i understand it right, and truly wanting for nothing. it certainly is a beast of a beer, not just at this strength, but also with this amount of oak and sweetness, its a lot of everything, and its a proper sipper to say the least. deep deep caramel in color, reddish in the right light, neither murky nor clear, someplace in between, with just a short frothy khaki colored layer of foam on it from the bottle. the nose is crazy, an awful lot of bourbon and oak, i think it was heaven hill barrels they uses for this, and two years in them! heavy vanilla, wet tobacco, and english toffee abound there, some light tannins from the wood, as well as some oxidation when i taste it, something i never really mind in the style, and really is a sign of its maturity. the malt is huge, sweet like brown sugar and maple, and carrying that vanilla tune pretty nicely though the whole drink, a ton of body on it and a long linger even with the abundant alcohol at the end, its persistent. oxidation meets a robust english yeast strain too, bready and doughy even, adding a lot of depth. no hops really to speak of, although overall this somehow has some balance between all the elements at the end. whiskey for miles, boozy and sweet, dense and even chewy, but also fully wintery, warming, and satisfying. something to be shared for sure, but a prime example of the style and what extended barrel ageing looks like. impressive and worthy of being celebrated. that said, not the most interesting barleywine i have ever had, not the most dialed in i dont think either, but a special beer without a doubt!",4.42

1285,King Sue,16oz Can poured into a Spiegelau IPA Glass. Canned 05/13/21.,4.63
1286,King Sue,"Poured from a can into a snifter
Appearance – The beer pours a super hazy orange color -yellow color with a one finger head of puffy white foam. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a good sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is massive of a raw hop smell with tons of herbal, pine and grapefruit smells. Along with these aromas comes a big showing of a yeastiness and lots of breadiness. At the same time the hop and malt are balanced by some rather strong and sweet fruit aromas of peach, tangerine, and mango. Overall, the smell is very hoppy and inviting.
Taste – The taste begins with a rather strong flavor of a sweet malt taste with a thick bready and doughy flavor that is matched by fruit flavors of tangerine, orange, and some tropics of mango and papaya. At the start there are a decent showing of hops, with flavors of grapefruit and herb being the strongest. As the taste advances the sweetness gets even stronger and is joined by more hop of grapefruit and herb as well as a little bit of pine and floral hop flavors. With the transition of flavors, one is left with a rather sweet and malty, but nice raw hopped taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is slightly more chewy and thick with a carbonation level that is medium. Overall, the feel was good for the mix of flavors and made for an easy drinker.
Overall – A decently good IPA. A little on the malty and sweet side, but it does have a nice raw and flavorful hop hit.",4
1287,King Sue,"I was surprised when saw king Sue on tap in a local bar. Ordered a pint , it was served in a frosted pint glass. As you know this is a renouned beer rated 100 on BA and # 49 in the top rated beer list. Have to say it lives up to it’s hype. This beer is an orange gold color with a thick white lasting head. Very complex aroma of citrus, pine, and herbs. The taste is also complex but is so well blended that nothing stands out. Full mouthfeel and a finish that matches the aroma. King Sue is just about the best Hazy IPA I have ever tasted. I asked for an unfrosted glass for my 2OND pint.",4.73
1288,King Sue,"Poured the look and color of raw honey with an almost white head which leaves copious amounts of lacing.
The aroma was wonderful, I could actually smell it! The Citra hops are well represented here, no doubt. Citrus and mango and maybe pineapple?
The taste, wow. This can was packaged 4/23/21 so I have to wonder what it is like “fresh” but as it was, it was one of the best double IPAs I have ever had.
Certainly the best in the NEIPA category.
The feel? Awesome, smooth and soft and just too easy to drink.
I will be keeping my eye out for this in hopes of finding fresh releases in Michigan.",4.74

1291,Headroom,On tap at the tasting room. Cloudy/milky orangish/yellow pour with a white head. More tangy than I’m accustomed too from Trillium.

1296,Headroom,"Succulent banana milk haze in the glass, with a solid finger of rocky white foam. Smells like a New York City fruit cart on a hot summer day. The kind of juicy, drippy ripe fruit that you can smell from a block and a half away. Taste follows with sun-warmed pineapple, lychee, and whipped cream. Mouthfeel is soft & creamy, and fully coating. Finishes with a hit of resinous pine, and orange rind. Remarkable effort in a month of truly remarkable Trillium beers.",4.59
1297,Headroom,Another Trillium winner. Excellent balance in all respects. This brewery does it really well and this has just about everything a drinker would want in a hazy New England IPA. Nice.,4.25

1299,Headroom,"16 oz. can. Murky orange body. Smells of onions, lime zest, tropical fruit, and sweet pale malt. Taste has strong orange and lime zest. Garlic comes behind it.

Never one to linger on smell that but this one comes across right away with wafting a bright citrus. The taste is up there with best I have had.

1321,Cable Car,"October 16th, 2015 - This 2014 Cable Car is nothing short of a work of art. A gorgeous rich blonde color, the experience starts with the aroma. Oh sweet, heavily ambrosia. Real vanilla and custard on the top, followed by a ginger note, then braised pear. The bouquet continues with clove, all-spice and a dash of saffron, and finally a cooling aroma of oatmeal. The flavor definitely distinguishes this beer as a sour ale, but the balance between acidity and other flavors is masterful. A long saffron taste pairs with the sourness and is followed by a lemon zest aftertaste. Between sips my mouth warmths with the taste of shortbread, but that breaks with each sip as well, as muscat grape cleanses the palate to make way for each new round of the complex flavors. Truly an exceptional brew.",4.47
1322,Cable Car,"2018 bottle on site at Toronado. I think it was worth every penny and if you’re on the fence and reading this, just get it!

1326,Cable Car,"At last, I got to try this one. The hallmark of this one is the complexity. There are layers upon layers of sour fruit, wood, mineral earthiness, dank funk, and acidic fruits.

L: golden color, ever-so-slightly cloudy, big white foamy head
S: somewhat muted at first since I was drinking this outside, but as it warmed and I went inside the aroma really shined through. Lemon, peach, apricot, pear, funk minor white grape. The funkiness was singular and one I had never smelled before. Very enjoyable aroma!
T: Taste was great also. Lemon and stone fruits were the headliners here along with that uncommon and nice funkiness.
F: Mouthburst was subtle and not sharp at the end, so it was nice-drinking throughout.
O: It was difficult to finally grab this, especially without having to pay the Toronado prices, but it was well worth the effort! One of my all time favorite sours, easily! Very high class!",5
1336,Cable Car,"Right in line with some of the best sours out there. Great taste and feel, but didn't get an outstanding smell from it. Nothing bad, just didn't blow my socks off. Overall, very glad to have tried this one out.",4.45

1338,Cable Car,"What a great surprise to get to try this at Toronado during Duck Days of Summer. 2016 Vintage. Poured into a goblet, it is a beautiful golden/orange color with a slight haze, and 1 finger of head. Smells was most stone fruit, peaches, apricots, a bit of lemon. Big creamy body with the right amount of dryness, acidity (mild), and tart & funk. I know they price point turns some folks off, but I considered this a treat and a beer I'd probably never have again so $60 seemed well worth it to me. If I do get another chance to drink this again, I won't hesitate.",4.77

F: Full-bodied, creamy, and thick
O: Honestly when I first heard about this in late spring it sounded incredibly gimmicky and the 3 Sons hype only fueled the fire. After seeing consistently strong ratings, I managed to land a bottle and I'm extremely glad I did. Rare Scooop was one of the more complex, interesting, and well executed beers I've had in awhile.

Excellent combo if you ask me, would love to see this collaboration happen again. Cycle and 3 sons are putting out phenomenal beers.",4.85

1359,Rare Scooop,"On draft at Cycle. Pours pitch black with a ring of tan lacing around the edge of the glass. Chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry ice cream are obvious on the aroma and taste. Each is distinct on it's own and they blend together beautifully. Doesn't taste artificial. Drinks rich, smooth, and sweet just like and ice cream sunday, but it's not just a one note dessert beer. Roasted malt comes in especially on the finish, and the barrel character is perfect for this style. The oak provides a subtle dryness on the finish that helps to balance the sweetness. The bourbon offers caramel, vanilla, and toasted coconut. There's a quiet burn mid palate and soothing warmth on the finish. The mouth feel is medium and sticky and coats the whole palate. This is one of the best Cycle stouts I've had. I was skeptical about strawberry flavor in a stout, but it was delicious. The various parts of this beer work really well together.",4.71

Rarely do I find myself saying that :) Had the chance to try this twice and it amazed me both times!!!!!",5
1362,Rare Scooop,"Pours black with a brown head (maybe hints of pink in the head or could be my imagination). Smells like any other stout with the malty/chocolate aroma.

1363,Rare Scooop,"I had a few beers in my time, but this one is from outer space. Never had anything similar or one that came close. This is a dessert on its own. Chocolate strawberries and some nice bourbon boozy-ness. Well done for sure and probably worth the hype.",4.77
1364,Rare Scooop,This is one of the most unique and most impressive beers I have ever had. You get to taste every bit of the Neapolitan ice cream in the description in all the best ways. Definitely a dessert beer but not at all too sweet in my opinion. A wonderful experience,5

1376,Aaron,"Had on tap at HFB after bottle run. Absolutely extraordinarily perfect high octane version of a English Barleywine. Had a beautiful if brief light tan head; excellent residual lacing. Rich tawny orange- ruby accented color. Like a beautiful piece teak. Both simple and then complex to light.
Nose was rich with toffee/caramel; wood; vanilla; soft herbal flower and bitterness. Taste magnified all these and slowly revealed tannins; slight hints of licorice; apple; and allspice as it warmed. Sweetness but never candy or cloying. Traces of whiskey helped round out flavors but well in background.
Feel was luxuriantly soft and smooth; very mildly dense like young port but never thick or distracting.
Oh and $4 for 4oz glass????
Absurdly good beer and very accessible cost.
Barreled EBW is one of my favorite styles ... and Aaron is without question the best I’ve ever had.
Masterpiece.",5
1377,Aaron,"Bottle. I have been waiting for this bitch for ages. I tried both the 2016 & 2018 batches. This was one of my biggest wants because I figured Hill Farmstead does everything else great, I bet they would nail a Barleywine as well. Oh, and it is barrel aged for like an eon. Aaron pours a dark brown. Not necessarily clear bodied behind the tint of the beer. A thin, defeated ring of diminutive bubbles rest steadily around the outer conversion of beer and glass; the only thing minute about this beer. The aroma rises out of the glass like a slothful perfume. Thick, damp whiffs of bourbon, raisins, toffee, and dessert wine. Detailed, rich, royal. The flavor marches in line with the nose. Heavy, sweet, and decadent. I think the older batch has a bit more complexity but lacks the barrel character of it's newer kin. I get some flavors of boozy dates and maple syrup from both, though. Of course the feel stands abreast with the other elements of the beer. Portly, heavy, and warming. Toothsome but intense. Definitely lived up to the hype I personally gave this beer. The best Barleywine I have ever had.",4.7

1384,Aaron,"Poured from fridge temp into a snifter. Pours a dark murky brown with quickly dissipating tan head. Nose is very bourbon forward, with notes of nuts, grapes, toffee, brown sugar. Taste is amazing. Feels like a 15 year old English barley wine laced with bourbon. Has those amazing bourbon notes, along with caramel, brown sugar, maple, cherries, and figs. Has a syrupy feel to it. It tastes great, but I must say it is not my favorite BA barley wine. That's not to say this isn't amazing - just didn't live up to the hype. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous. Overall, a great BA barley wine and worth seeking out if this is your style.",4.34

1391,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,Cognac sweetness balanced with oak comes through on the nose so strong. Amazing. The balance of flavors combining the barrel and barleywine is incredible. The ABV is so well hidden. Incredible beer. Complex and powerful,4.75

1393,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"Caramel apple, fruit leather, and a wave of oak w/ hint of orchard rot on the finish. When cold, what it lacks in complexity it gains in its expression of candied fruit, which evolves from a bold apricot-like sweetness to a drying apple skin/orchard rot/barrel tannin character on the finish. Although it wasn't aged in Cognac barrels, the fruity quality and heat on the finish gives the impression of Cognac or at least some fortified wine.",4.6

Taste is so deep, really get the barrel character in a rich way, with booze, flavoring and wood all dynamic, with rich toffee/caramel, molasses, and everything from the smell, especially dark fruits.

1407,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,On tap at the recent HOTD fredfest event.,4.5
1408,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"I will say this is probably the best barley wine I tasted. It poured a dark murky brown - almost like prune juice (but not in a bad way!). Very little head, probably due to high alcohol content. The smell is just delicious - picked up notes of heavy dark fruits soaked in bourbon with oak, toffee, and vanilla. More than what words can describe. The taste was just outstanding - again tons of bourbon soaked dark fruits. Very sweet with notes of toffee and vanilla that became more prominent at room temperature. The bourbon was up front from start to finish with a nice spiciness. There is just a subtle hop bite but its pretty much a desert in the glass. No alcohol warmth despite its ultra high ABV content. Very full-bodied, sticky, and rich. Overall: seek this out, it will not disappoint! Because of its high alcohol content, I was glad to share with a friend.",4.97
1409,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"375ml bottle, from the 2017 release. Served in a snifter glass. Pours an ugly as shit murky brown body, one finger white head, short retention, no lacing. This is a damn ugly beer, even for barleywines. Smell is transcendent; huge caramel, toffee, bourbon notes, distinct sweet brandy/cognac notes, with trace of spicy fruit on the backend. This is as metal/barleywine as it gets. Flavour follows, thick syrupy caramel, mild earthy bitterness that does just enough to balance it out and prevent this beer from being too sweet or cloying. No alcohol heat, plenty of oak and whiskey flavours, toffee, touch of resin and spice. Wonderful. Mouthfeel is full bodied, not cloying or syrupy, incredibly substantial, lots of complexity throughout, with a sweet nutty toffee finish. Overall, a damn delicious barleywine. I like this better than the single cognac releases that signify the first 3 releases.",4.68

1414,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"For a barleywine, it doesn't get much better than this. Poured from bottle on 1-13-18, thanks to Matthew for sharing! Dirty brown water is what it looks like to me. Smells rich and inviting, with a very faint hint of barrel aging. Damn smooth, with an English barleywine flavor, and once again a hint of barrel. Alcohol is insanely hidden. Was happy to get the chance to try this.",4.69
1415,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"L: pours a super thick dark brown. No head, looks amazing.
S: big spirits, I know it's double barrel, but the cognac is prominent. Smooth and sweet barrel aroma, very nice.
T: big sweetness with the cognac starting to shine then the bourbon comes in and mutes it. I don't think the double barrel makes it better.
F: so damn thick and smooth. World class feel, amazing.
O: I prefer the cognac to this, but this was a treat for sure. Awesome beer.",4.77

Supplication
Russian River Brewing
Date: 21 November 2019
I will start my day with a wild ale; I have tried most of the sours from RRB, they have been phenomenal. I used a tulip glass; the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and airy light tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left zero lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, dark amber with rusty orange hues. The beer is somewhat hazy. The appearance of the beer is beautiful.
When I pulled the cork out, wine and oak aromas emitted. Nosing further in the glass, I detect sour apple cider, funky barn, horse blanket, cherries, toasted crackers, and leather. Smelling the beer several times, I sense floral ester, a touch of phenols, and a slight fruity sweetness.
The beer's aromas are sharp but did do not relate to the taste. The flavors are brett, oak, vinous, sour apple cider, horse blanket, dankness, funky barnyard, herbal, hay, cherries, lightly toasted malts, leather, phenolic, and earthiness.
The mouthfeel is astringent, tart, and dry. The body of the beer is medium-light, high carbonation, and delightfully long finish.
This beer is incredible. One of the best sours I have consumed to date. I was bracing for the sourness to rip my palate apart; I got the latter, a delicate ballet on my tongue. Near perfect balance, nothing the beer is trying to outdo other flavors. I loved this beer!",4.84
1417,Supplication,"Gift from Ti. 375 ml bottle, cork & cage. Pours reddish brown with a small off white head. Aroma: Brett, white wine. Taste: Brett, white wine, apple, stone fruit, black pepper. Excellent sour.",4.69
1418,Supplication,"Pours a dark nutty brown with mild fog. Head is a finger and a half of tan foam that bubbles away quickly. Aroma is cherry, Pinot noir, with a earthy, bready malts and stone and cellar notes. Flavor profile is cherry with stone, cellar, Pinot noir, berry, and bready malts. Mouth feel is bubbly and effervescent with a medium thickness. Overall, big depth with a little sour zing and a sweet wine pop. Well aged, considering this was bottled March 12, 2019, and reviewed/consumed on May 22, 2021.",4.44
1419,Supplication,"The beer, poured into a wine glass developed a quick settling head atop it's murky copper hue. The aroma was what I had been craving. I was greeted with Brett and some nice funk. Notes of oak, fermenting red wine, and an aroma that I can only describe as impending tartness. There was also something fruity on the nose. The first sip was very funky and dry. The Brett was on full display and not much else. Over the next few sips the beer came to life. The funk mellowed a bit to give way to spicy oak, a bit of grain, and an increasing amount of fruit. This was all presided over by a bright but balanced tartness. A bit of carbonation lightened it up as it slowly faded from my palate. This was simply exquisite.",4.67
1420,Supplication,"I'm probably being a little generous here with the rating but this is hands down the best beer I've ever tried. Found it in the back of total wine in the keg cooler, walked through the plastic curtains with the sensor lights flicking on to be greeted by this gem. ""Limit 2/customer"" a sign read, being the only beer brand back there it felt like I stumbled across the crystal skull of the alcohol superstore, and with 100pt rating I just had to try it. im not much of a beer person but this changed my view 100% and made me realize beers CAN be delicious and just as complex as wines and special spirits.

Smell/Taste: The taste and smell are exactly what one would hope for in a wild ale. Some fantastic cherry sour taste and aroma, with the aged pinot and oak barrels providing some deep complexity
Feel: Some carbonation, but not too overpowering.
Overall: This is one of my all time favorites. I had tried a number of wild ales before, but this is the on that got me hooked. Absolutely, a tremendous beer",4.65

1431,Supplication,"Bottled 07/21/17. I was expecting the cork to pop, it didn’t. The pour is very dark, light head that doesn’t last. You can smell the Pinot and cherries. None of the flavors are dominant. Really nice balance between the tart and the residual wine aspects, and just the right amount of funk. I need to try a newer bottle for comparison.",4.54
1432,Supplication,Smells wonderful! It’s truly a fine Belgium inspired brew that any fine monk would enjoy. Amazing how the taste of the Pinot noir enhances the taste buds when I am usually adverse to wine alone. Just outstanding!,4.44
1433,Supplication,"It looks beautiful with light carbonation remaining after a pour. The smell is a bit muted but you can smell a bit of funk. There's so much happening in the taste. The carbonation is spot on. I don't taste outright cherries but I get the bret. The funk is not incredibly strong, but it's there to keep things interesting. This was bottled 1/25/18 and I wonder how that has affected the taste. It's very smooth, if it weren't so expensive I could drink this all day long. I am glad I have another bottle from my visit and I'm curious how a couple of more years will affect it.",4.5

Aroma: Wow, this could be a best selling men’s cologne! Musky, musty, earthy, funk,cedar, wine & a lot more than I can identify.
Taste: Wow, there is some much going on here. A fascinating blend of t bitter, tart & salty. Add cherries, vanilla & alcohol to those listed in the aroma to make one of the most complex flavor profiles I’ve ever tasted.
Feel: Wow, it’s the perfect blend of viscosity, carbonation & alcohol. It makes the mouth happy.
Overall: Wow, this beer is incredible! Paired with a good cheese like an aged emmi, you get a double dose of earthyness. Oh, no! My class is empty, 12 oz is not enough. Why didn’t I buy 4 or 6?",4.84

1452,It Was All A Dream,"Incredibly sweet, a straight up dessert beer for sure. It had delicious, intense coconut dominating the overall flavor profile. Mouthfeel was excellent, no complains at all. Only good in small quantities though, due to the cloying sweetness.",4.45

1489,Oude Geuze Vintage,"Enjoyed much more than I expected to. I'm one of those rare people who's not in love with the standard Oude Geuze, but found this to be much more approachable. That being said, I'd take the Golden Blend over this in a heartbeat.",4.17
1490,Oude Geuze Vintage,"2012 version, at Lambik-o-droom. Slightly hazy dark golden color with creamy beige head. Aroma starts with hay, dry meadow flowers, unripe stonefruits and some lemon. Taste starts tart upfront with unripe fruits, but also with a fruit pits, seeds and skin bitterness. Hay and farmhouse notes throughout, funky but not too extreme. Light to medium body, dry, light to medium carbonation. A really well rounded gueuze, sour but quite easy to drink, funky but not cloying.",4.5
1491,Lou Pepe - Framboise,Enjoyed this in Brussels. Love raspberry and the Lambic balance was excellent. The beer is relatively acidic to the mouth so be prepared. Love this as a desert .,4.64
1492,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750 ml corked and capped bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5%. Made with 300 g of raspberries per liter beer. Clear signal red colour, moderate pink head. Intense aroma of raspberries (no surprise). The flavour is very sour with notes of lemons and raspberries, fairly dry and crisp.",3.5
1493,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2015 vintage. Tart raspberries with typical funk. Had the 2012 Kriek and the 2013 side by side. The kriek was a touch superior, followed closely by the framboise.",4.75
1494,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Today our fence is being repaired after a Tornado ripped through the neighborhood almost three weeks ago, so I am celebrating by drinking Cantillon Lou Pepe Framboise (2015). It was among the best Lambics that I've ever had.",4.68

1496,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Beautiful red slightly pinkish color with a thin head.
Sour aroma with notes of raspberries, horse mantle, lemon drops and nice funkiness.
Flavor with notes of lemon sourness, raspberries, white wine, mild sulfur, lactic acid and oak. Dry aftertaste with practically no residual sugar.
Light body with mild carbonation. It is not flat as in Lambic.
This is how a Fruit Lambic should be. No sugar residues with the raspberries fruitiness that is an extension of the natural Lambic flavors.",4.13
1497,Lou Pepe - Framboise,Vibrant ruby with a soft head settling to a persistent creamy white film and thick collar.,4.44

1499,Lou Pepe - Framboise,From a bottle shared at la fête de la brasserie de la Pleine Lune 2019.,4.74
1500,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"The beer pours a ruby red with a big fluffy pink head. It has medium high carbonation. The beer smells of raspberries, funk, almonds, and vanilla. It tastes lightly tart, with raspberries, almonds, vanilla, and light funk. The feel is very light and dry. A tasty lambic from Cantillon.",4.64
1501,Lou Pepe - Framboise,75cl bottle drank at the brewery in Brussels. Poured into 25cl Cantillon glass,4.54
1502,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle at brewery. Ruby hued body with a sudsy, quickly dissipating pale pink head. Smells exactly like a fresh picked raspberry crushed between the fingers. Taste is like a raspberry with the sweetness mostly sucked out of it: the tartness from the natural innoculation complements the inherent raspberry tartness very well. Medium bodied with a lingering fruity character. Complex and elegant",4.61
1503,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"08/2015 - Raspberry jam fosho, tannic, funk, and barnyard up front; very tart, big acidity, more raspberries, and just jam on the palate; flavorful finish of raspberry, cherry, and a wee bit of pepper to round it out.",4.6
1504,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Reddish pour. Tastes of raspberry. Very tough to get this beer in the USA. Beer is quite tart compared to other offering from Cantillion. Still solid, and highly recommend.",4.5
1505,Lou Pepe - Framboise,Had a 2015 vintage,4.5
1506,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"This one poured a bright red with a slight pink head that didn't last long.
The first smell was like sticking my face into a jar of fresh raspberry jam, deeper in the slight funk and oak began coming through. A bit of acidity is there too.
Taste follows, tart raspberry, a nice touch of funk and oak. 
Light to medium body, dry finish.
Overall an amazing beer!",4.71
1507,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"a 2010 vintage generously shared with me after quite literally years of anticipating this bottle together. its incredible stuff, worth the wait, and as good as anything i have had from these guys really, every bit as good as the lou kriek or the fou. deep dusty brick red in color, dense with fruit here, not as electric and bright looking as a lot of raspberry beers, and with a fizzy lazy head, not super robust there. the nose is mind melting for me, pure raspberry and insanely mature lambic funk and tartness, turbid wheaty aged hop base, tons of oak and brett, a well developed wild acidity as well, this is rather piquant, and then of course all the berry, as natural as it gets and like stuffing an entire handful of them in my face, as intense as can be. i smell it for awhile before i taste it, so complex and mouthwatering and inviting. great sourness up front in the flavor highlights the fruit right from the start, with the sturdy wood and mature wildness right there with it, tart and red winey towards the finish, a little sweet from the fruit, still malty in a lambic sense, and really brightly acidic and interesting. the complexity of the yeast elements here is as good as it gets, and why cantillon is so well regarded as far as i am concerned. the raspberries are perfect with it, and really bold in this beer. the maturity is unrivaled and the flavor is just incredible. beautiful lambic, famous for a reason, and probably even more striking to me now in terms of quality because there are so many lackluster fruited sours out there in the world. this is the cream!",4.6
1508,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2012 bottle poured into a stemmed tulip. Beautiful looking beer. Deep burgundy in color. Pinkish white head that dissipates quick. Aromas of raspberry and funk. Some earthiness in there. Flavor is tart raspberries and funk. More tart than I thought it’d be. Feelnis as you’d expect for this style. Overall, another outstanding Cantillon beer.",4.54
1509,Lou Pepe - Framboise,2014 vintage at the brewery.,4.7
1510,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"750 ml, 2012 (bottled/released fall 2015). Pours between brick and blood red, slightly hazy, and with minimal head. Nose takes you down two roads. Fresh and acidic/preserved cherries and raspberries and ice cream come through. Alongside, dandelions, hay, Brett, and tart apple. Fruit is amazing compared to Rose de Gambrinus. I think this will be my first ever 5 for nose. Flavor has acidity and intensity of straight raspberry juice paired with funky lemon peel and a fresh herbal greenery that is hard to place. Almost like an intense mixed drink. Prickly crisp carbonation. Funky monkey this is a good beer, even compared to other Cantillon beers. Honestly, the intensity will make this 750 ml bottle an all afternoon affair.",4.64
1511,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2013 vintage.
Pours deep red with little head
Aroma is huge, raspberry jam, little funk, barnyard, honey, burnt rubber, wet cellar.
Taste is raspberry all over, so fresh, hay, funky, sour finish",4.68
1512,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Had at Cantillon brewery, from bottle.",4.52
1513,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Bottle with a 2013 sticker. Reluctant to rate because this is such a distinctive beer, at once subtle and strong, and this is the first time I've had anything by Cantillon. I found it amazing, but also palate challenging. It's kind of like first time listening to Coltrane. You're not sure how to describe it or judge it, and you're at once thrilled and in over your head, but you know repetition seems really worth pursuing and will alter your tastes.",4.46
1514,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2012 sticker poured into a fluted glass. While this beer is visually striking with a lovely raspberry scent, the taste and mouthfeel are the stars here. Fantastic balance of funk, fruit and sour. Even a hour after opening there is still huge carbonation. A complete joy. One of the best beers I've ever had.",4.93
1515,Lou Pepe - Framboise,"2013 bottle. That was EXTREME, could feel the smell from the bottle and the off flavors here were kind of unpleasant in the first 15-20 minutes. The funk was so strong we couldnt have the first sip, and i'm not talking about horsey aromas but some kind of fishey/rotten food/mold and more. After waiting for the beer to get warmer the aromas morphed into something more fruity and the framboise finally came up. Very very sour on the palate, mid carbonation. What an experience this was, scary and amazing!",4.06
1516,Citra,2021 Vintage,4.44
1517,Citra,"Canned on 3/22, freshest I've had by some margin!
L: Eschews classic West Coast IPA visual with a slightly more opaque and deeper color than other classics of the style. Beautiful lacing on glass after some sips, yet head dissipates rather quickly. This has little bearing on the beer overall personally, a minor complaint.
S: Lovely nose of tropical notes. Smells of fruit and citrus, not an overpoweringly strong scent yet clearly expresses the flavor profile to expect.
T: Citrus and fruit flavor explodes here. Measured bitterness reminds that this is a West Coast IPA, yet has a juiciness that has come to be associated with NEIPAs nowadays. Hoppy and fruity, taste follows suit on the nose and then some.
F: Perfectly measured medium body, finishes on the dry side yet the tropical fruit and citrus notes linger for some time.
O: My third experience with Citra, I think I can conclude that this is my favorite West Coast IPA of them all. The juicier and sweeter characteristics of it as opposed to other notable examples of the style put it over the edge as a truly original and exciting beer. Drank fresh, it is an absolute revelation in a time where the IPA market is oversaturated and often difficult to get excited about. Seek it out!",4.86
1518,Citra,"Points off on looks only because the head is fairly scrawny; much less than a finger in my pint glas;. nice lacing though. I have a lousy nose but as soon as I opened the can I could smell fruity goodness with citrus dominating. The taste is so well balanced, with a good amount of juicy +hoppy. Citrus flavors dominate but certainly only part of a really well balanced flavor profile. I really like this one a lot. More, please.",4.74
1519,Citra,"Pours a beautiful glowing copper, clear and clean. The aroma isn’t as big and vibrant as I might expect, but more subdued and muted. It’s bursting with flavor, all that citra goodness, with just enough heft and body on the back. I thought it was fantastic.",4.46
1520,Citra,Huge thanks to Ryan for this can!,4.5
1521,Citra,L: A darker filtered orange with an sizable ivory head settling down to a wisp and a wide band that climbs the glass and leaves a couple narrow partial bands of lace.,4.21
1522,Citra,L: Medium opiate amber in color minimal head that hands on the glass.,4
1523,Citra,I picked it off a menu at Stout in LA. What an amazing aroma and taste. Could tell the hops were citrus and could smell the pine. A nice orange amber color. Left me wanting to have another as soon asI can find it again.,4.55
1524,Citra,"This is a great, old-school West Coast IPA with a strong malt backbone and a solid use of Citra hops. This was a game changer back in the day and still deserves its due respect.",4.5
1525,Citra,"Refrigerated can to glass. No canning date, but believe it to be about a month old.
Tan almost orange. Little cloudy. Minimal off white head. Nice lacing.
Citrus and pine on the nose.
Taste starts out sweet and citrusy, but then ends bitter with astringency.
Soapy aftertaste and burps. Slight booze presence.
I think Pliny has made me spoiled.",3.89
1526,Citra,"Citra pours a beautiful amber orange with a soapy and loose, 2-finger, light yellow head that deposits some minimal lacing. The smell is resiny and dank with citrus fruits, a hint of floral and a slight malt sweetness. The taste is initially smooth and sweet over the palette with a dank, hop bitterness from the Citra, giving off flavors of grapefruit, pineapple and a hint of zest. Truly an outstanding DIPA, comparable, maybe better than Pliny the Elder for me. Took nearly 2 years to finally find a can up my way in NoCal and this is an impressive beer!",4.67

Awesome citra smell and super choppy taste. Rivals the alchemists. Gets a bit bitter as I make my way through the glass. 16 oz draft.",4.61

1535,Citra,"On-draught at Verdugo Bar, Los Angeles. I've waited a long time to try this one.",3.84
1536,Citra,Had on tap at KRBC. Unremarkable head at beginning...but stunning rich amber honey color... and outstanding lacing. Full hop aroma and a citrus bomb for flavor. So clean and drinkable. Reamarkabke easy for an 8% DIPA. Definitely built in the malts perfectly. Yep... lived up to the hype.,4.42
1537,Citra,"Having on draft in a pint glass. Dark amber color with a slight haze and one finger head. Smells of burnt caramel and toasted orange rind. Totally full bodied with creamy carbonation texture. Flavors of roasted pineapple, peach with toasted orange rind bitterness. Long lasting fruit sweetness and bitterness.",4.25
1538,Citra,L: Pours a beautiful golden color. 2 fingers of foamy head with good retention.,4.59
1539,Citra,"Best IPA I've ever had. I waited years to finally get a case of Citra and the wait was worth it. Scary drive to the brewery to pick up the case, but it was a fantastic trip.

1541,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Aged bottle. Jet black with hints of brown shading, brown cap. This one is more fitting of the dark lord moniker as it doesn't hold anything back. Huge bourbon booze starts the nose with chocolate fudge, roasted malt, coffee, solid rustic oak, molasses, dried dark fruit, and vanilla. Taste is much the same as the nose but not as nuanced, barrel stays strong, vanilla steps up, caramel enters in, dark fruit fades away. Feel is big, boozy and dark, just what they are going for, even with some age it still bites. I'm sure this will be controversial but I like the non-ba version better as an all around RIS, but when in the mood for a beast of a beer this will suffice, tough certainly on the sweeter end",4.29
1542,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I've been chasing this beer for a while now - bottle counts always seem lower than other adjuncted variants, and no one seems to want to let one go. So, finally caught it on tap this year!",4.35

Pours pitch black like motor oil in the glass with little head. Smell is sweet chocolate. Getting some light bourbon and oak notes, also dark fruits. Taste is chocolate, raisin, caramelized sugar, cherry, with a little bourbon coming through. Thick, viscous beer. Overall, very impressed. This smooths out regular dark lord, and does A LOT to calm down the cloying sweetness of reg DL. Still very sweet, but much more balanced. Not big bourbon notes, would take this down a notch in my book, but overall was impressed. Very enjoyable.",4.54

Revisited for draft pour of 2019 vintage at 2019 DLD. pours thick black with no head and very little carbonation to speak of. smell is Dark Lord roast and sweetness with some whiskey sting. i do not get a lot of bourbon on the nose but i never have with the bourbon barrel-aged variants. taste is a toned down, less sweet version of Dark Lord with bourbon barrel-aging notes to back it up. it’s quite amazing. the combination of a year on the regular Dark Lord plus in bourbon barrels to give it that sweet oaky vanilla and caramely bourbon flavors. feel is low carb and thick. Dark Lord was truly meant to stand the test of time in barrels. overall, this is probably my go-to, could-consistently-drink DL variant. less sweet than Handjee, not as adjuncted as loadstar or Rrari or chemtrail. a really good barrel-aged Russian imperial stout.",4.54

1562,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),Syrupy stout with a feel that completely coats your mouth and never surrenders.

Almost tastes like a wine/liqueur than a beer.,3.38

1564,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Big, dark, and delicious - this stands on the shoulders of the regular DL (which I have always found to be a bit of a letdown).

Very hazy yellow color with lots of fluffy white head and thick sheets and rings of lingering lacing that clung to the glass and did not fade away. Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, mango, papaya, tangerine, passionfruit and guava; also malt, caramel, creamy vanilla and some weaker floral hops. Some dankness in the background. Taste follows the nose, great balance between the slightly bitter hops and sweeter malt backbone. Extremely juicy. At first I was going to give the smell/taste ratings of 4/4.25 since they were surprisingly muted and I was disappointed. But then as the beer warmed a little the second glass was incredible, more pungent and flavorful and complex with more depth. This is what I was looking for!

1591,Nectarine Premiere,"this one has been on my most wanted list for awhile, so huge thanks to my boy for scoring this for us to share, what a gem! its as good as i hoped it would be, the nectarine popping in here, natural and juicy, the essence of the fruit as so many de garde beers deliver, and it seems right in its peak, bottle from september 2020. pale brew with some haze through most of the bottle, very fizzy but not holding a ton of head, and a nose that my mouth is still watering from, wow its puckery, nectarous, and juicy, ripe and sweet and sour at the same time, wood heavy, fully wild, incredible aroma here and it gets better as it warms, more fruit, more funk, more wood. the flavor is fantastic, the fruit hits mostly at the end, its mature vinous funky wild beer up front, slightly raw on the grain side maybe some unmalted wheat in here, pils malt, doughy and crackery and simple but earthy. the ferment is sharp but not overly sour, tannic from the oak, maybe some white wine character too, lots of well developed bretty funk too. when the fruit hits its like taking a bite of a ripe nectarine, and it stays on the tongue through the finish. impressively real, forward, and its crazy this is as dry as it is because the fruit is so sweet, amazing. this has already developed well in the bottle, but i think its safe to say even more time would evolve it further. its maybe not as complex on the yeast side as my favorite de garde beers, but the fruit element is as good as it gets. great carbonation here too, lively and excited feeling on the palate, fits the summery fruitiness. loved this, very thankful! i know this is one of their highest rated beers, but its probably not even in my top five from them, amazing as it is...",4.45

1593,Nectarine Premiere,"To-go can, getting to finally try a Degarde for the 2nd time. The color looks stone fruit peach oranges. The smell is very distinct of sourness, vinegary, slight fruit notes. Overall I was hoping for that special first sip that takes my breath away but a bit disappointment bit nevertheless, it's good. Cheers",4.2
1594,Nectarine Premiere,"Poured from fridge temp but allowed to warm a few degrees. Pours a gorgeous opaque orange with barely any head (on an aggressive pour). The nose is mind-blowing. It's bursting with fresh nectarines. Also getting a good amount of orange creamsicle. A touch of tartness and some sour patch kids. Also getting a hint of leathery funk. The taste is amazing and nicely matches the nose. Again, nectarines dominate, and I love nectarines! Definitely some sourness upfront, but not mouth-puckering. Definitely getting some vanilla ice cream, a bit of wheat, and maybe a hint of orange peel. There is a nice tart-funkiness on the aftertaste. This is just a wonderful beer.",4.63
1595,Nectarine Premiere,"Extra mild, not much funk, tartness or sourness. Nectarines are fairly acidic and fruity. Lacks distinction - decent, not incredible. Fruit may have fallen off?",4

1598,Nectarine Premiere,"My first De Garde taste. WOW! best brew i think i ever had.
This is what i use to scale many of my beer ratings and is what i look for in a beer.",5
1599,Nectarine Premiere,Poured out as a slightly hazed orange color with a thin white head on top. The smell of the beer is packed with funky nectarine sourness which is to be expected from de Garde. The flavors are similar to the nosem lots of acidic funky nectarine coming in full speed from start to finish. The feel is light to medium bodied and dry. Overall it's a kick ass sour. So it's worthy seeking out if you're into that sort of thing.,4.25
1600,Nectarine Premiere,"04/2016 - as it warms, the fruit, funk, and oak ripen and delight the senses; the nectarine is lovely, but doesn't overwhelm the senses; digging the mouthfeel of this; traditional dG acidity in the back of the palate; juicy, sour, funky finish.",4.62

1603,Nectarine Premiere,I had b2 last year and knew I had to get my hands on more. B3 isn't quite as fruity or have the same mouthfeel but nevertheless it's very similar. Best nose on any sour period. Many people comment how you can smell chocolate or coffee or other things and I've always thought that these were more resembling characteristics but this beer really does smell like straight nectarines and nothing else. Beautiful citrus. The level of sour and acidity are damn near perfect. I've had quite a few DeGarde beers and this is hands down my favorite right with Imperial Stone Bu. When I traded for the B2 with the Peach I thought the Peach was a total let down compared to this gem. Totally worth trying at least once.,4.81
1604,Nectarine Premiere,"Had this on draft on site at De Garde.
L: Orange, like a hazy NE style IPA, maybe even a bit more orange. Head was about a finger width and stayed around for a while.
S: Like orange, apricot, and of course nectarines.
T: Sweet Nectar of the Gods. I mean sweet fruit and some cotton candy.
F: Nice and full.
O: Best ""sour"" I've had. I don't know if I could enjoy a beer more.",5
1605,Nectarine Premiere,"Pours a hazy yellow color with only a few fuzzy bubbles on the surface. Aroma is fresh, unripened nectarines, grapefruit pearl, lemon, and fresh oak, and some granny smith apple. Taste is like biting into a fresh nectarine that is more tart than juicy. There's a little acetic acid and band aid as is common with De Garde. It has a full flavor while maintaining a light airy freshness throughout. I get a rich, white wine note as it warms along with grapefruit pith and sour lemon candy. Carbonation is minimal but just enough to move the beer along. It's very esay to drink the 750 in one sitting. This is a fantastic beer.",4.56
1606,Nectarine Premiere,"Bottle on-site at de Garde. The aroma and flavor of this beer are incredible, but it had very low carbonation. Not sure if it was just the bottle I had or if that is typical. Either way, it is a great fruited wild ale.",4.45
1607,Nectarine Premiere,"I don't see how a wild can get any better than this! Pour is nectarine orange and opaque, with a fizzy short lasting head, but a bountiful ring of nectarine pulp decorating the rim of the glass all the way around that's there to stay. Nose is definately nectarine with some peach and star fruit, and taste is all nectarine. Mouthfeel is softly carbonately and tart on the finish. This thing is so good. Nice job de Garde!",4.69

1611,Nectarine Premiere,"Had a week ago.
Look was a hazy golden orange juice. Very nice!
Aroma was fantastic! Strong true nectarine and that distinctive barnyard hay/grassy DG funk. Surprising bubble gum aroma in the background.
Taste is thankfully similar to the aroma. Nectarine and funk really shine here! Aftertaste is same, and it lingers.
Mouthburst was good but not overwhelming, and carbonation not too strong.
Overall, it certainly impressed me. Among the top 5 sours I have had! Worth the effort in getting!",5
1612,Nectarine Premiere,"Really gorgeous beer here - and the oak wine barrels give it a nice complexity. I really wasn't even sure what a nectarine was, but I definitely know now!",4.37

Body is full and balanced, sour with the citric & lactic acid but they pair so well together in this beer especially with the sweetness of the nectarine.

Smells of sweet toasted malts and then big floral and citrus hop aromas. Taste is similar but not as sweet or heavy on the hops as the nose lets on. It's a great mix of floral, citrus, and a hint of melon hops with a more tasteful toasted malt underlying it all. Smooth, perfect amount of carbonation, overall an excellent beer.",4.5

Fruity aroma is not too potent to my nose, but there's some lemon and passionfruit juice. Flavor is a completely different level, with pineapple and tropical punch blasting through a bitter, hoppy backdrop which is unmistakably an IPA. Where this beer really excels is that it is both a juicy NE IPA and an American IPA at the same time, compromising on neither.",4.15

1622,Focal Banger,"Hazy yellowish-orange with a big foamy head. Aroma is lemon, grass, pine, blueberry. Taste is citrusy, especially lemon with a strong bitterness. Also blueberry flavor from the Mosiac hops. Juicier and fruitier than Heady Topper, which is more piney and astringent.",4.63

1626,Focal Banger,"Poured a few oz for a look, hazy yellow pour, decent white head which dissipates quickly. Aromas of citrus, tropical fruit, mango. Taste follows with a nice layer of that dank grassiness I got from Heady. Weedy tendencies here that I don’t mind at all. Excellent beer!",4.68
1627,Focal Banger,"Bought at Hazel's in Boulder, CO on 05/13/21. 4 pack of 16 oz cans for $18.49 before tax. Canned 05/04/21, consumed 06/01/21.",4.31
1628,Focal Banger,"It’s a toss up as to which I prefer, this or Heady Topper.
Only had one so I drank it from the can, so the appearance rating is an assumption.
Beyond that though…
The aroma amazing, the Citra and Mosaic hops play well together and the British malts don’t hurt.
The taste is really good, very nice IPA, nice hop bitterness but doesn’t diminish the flavor. Well done.
The feel, well, is subjective of course, but I think this one was excellent for the genre.
OA - yum. Happy to have been able to try this!",4.71
1629,Focal Banger,"This was the best beer I’ve had in a long time, the can reads that you should drink from the can so I didn’t get the colour, however the can had a good look to it, so I rated that a three and a half. The smell was pure tangerines and mango, very good smell. The taste was crisp with piney mosaic hops following the fruity taste at the beginning. It does have a little bit of a bite on the aftertaste. Rather bitter finish.",4.63

Looks like an IPA should on the pour. Pale gold body, white head. The scent is incredible from the glass. The freshness is evident.
Flavors are more concentrated when right out of the can. They are lighter and perhaps lifted when in the glass. Plenty of grapefruit flavor to be found.
I was surprised and happy to find this in a local place. The four pack cost me about twenty five dollars and I'm not angry about it.",4.53

1640,Focal Banger,"From a 16 ounce can dated 12/10/2020, a short pour gets a yellow hazy straw color. Had a fabulous head on the second pour. I tried it straight from the can too. Its aroma favors an almost skunky citrus smell that is very inviting. The taste is grapefruit, lemon, orange and the right amount of bitterness that wanes as you drink more. The mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing straight from the can. This is truly a fine NEIPA. I hope I get the chance to try it again. A special thanks to @laketang for the heads up on getting this Focal Banger and a couple more in the process that I don't normally get in Texas. I will admit I enjoyed it more poured in the proper glassware. The aroma is extra special.

1641,Black Tuesday,"Definitely one of those beers i've waited a long time to get. Found it in a 16 oz can. I've had So Happens it's Tuesday, which I loved, but this is my first of the original. Maybe $25 was too much, maybe not. We'll see. In any case it's the highest ABV of any beer i've ever tried. 17% was the highest I've sampled, but this knocks that back a couple points. I've got a 2020 bottle. Poured out into a snifter, half inch head bubbled up and licked the sides of the glass, receding into a thin collar of beige. The smell is exquisite. That's a strong word, i know, but i think it deserves that descriptor. It's full and strong, bourbon and licorice and fig, that stings the back of the nose as it goes in. 5 on the smell. Love it. Let's sip now, Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, licorice, fig, smoke, char, leather, damn, this is very comparable to Bourbon County Stout. This has been barrel aged for a year, and it sure picks up that bourbon flavor, filling the crevices of my mouth in such a delightful way. I had Indian food for dinner, and I love the layers Indian has, it seems to fill up every bit of my palate. This beer is the same way, it has a way of overcoming and washing over my tastebuds, allowing me to pick up on lots of layers of flavor. It's also like Indian because it's got a spiciness to it, that tickles my tongue and overwhelms me. There is light carbonation, and a medium mouthfeel, not too thick and not too thin. Overall I'm very impressed with this and i'm glad I bought two cans of it. This is the beer of a mature drinker. This is the beer of a wise man. This is the beer of a guy who's well traveled. This is the beer of a guy who's got a financial plan. This is the beer of a man with an important job. This is the beer of a man who knows how to relax with class. This is the beer of a good father. This is the beer of a faithful husband. This is the beer of a youthful grandpa. This is getting my top ratings. What a way to celebrate Father's Day 2021!",5
1642,Black Tuesday,This one is THICCC! Very dark and a strong boozy smell. Initial punch of booze and toffee up front and finishes nicely. This is a big one so definitely not on to tackle on your own!,4.24
1643,Black Tuesday,Completely unreal thick. Had a 2016 cellared for 4 years. Chocolate and bourbon and a boozy but smooth element. Torquey at almost 20%. All the elements of a world class stout with chocolate and vanilla and tobacco. A dessert,4.72

Pours dark with an average amount of head that dissipates quickly. Lots of bourbon and dark chocolate on the nose. Heavy bourbon on the taste and the 19.3% isn't hidden but it still drinks smooth for the abv. Also get some fig and chocolate. Mouthfeel is great but not as thick as i like, but then again with that abv it's pretty darn good. Great stout but would definitely need to share a 750ml with a friend or two.",4.31

16oz can poured into a tulip",4.45
1655,Black Tuesday,"Received from @2beerdogs in NBS BIF 10 – Thanks Derek! Reviewed 2/16/20.
2016 Edition. Etched on the shoulder above the rear label “B#3501 9/8/16” above “09:31 000906”. Stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 55 degrees (as stated on the label) in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 60.9 degrees F.
Appearance – 3.
First pour – Medium brown, clear.
Body – Dark brown/black, opaque. When held to direct light, brown around the top edge.
Head – Average (Maximum two cm, aggressive center pour), tannish with large bubbles fizzing away, gone within a minute after the pour is completed, leaving thin complete ring of tiny bubbles, fed by aggressive effervescence.
Lacing – None, not unexpected at 20.3% ABV.
Aroma – 4 - Has an almost weak, watery dark fruit aroma with some weak wood and possibly bourbon in the background, but I must really horn it to pick up the bourbon.
Flavor – 4 – This begins somewhat sweet with weak flavors of “dark fruit’’ with raisins being weakly predominant and prunes trailing behind. Dates are weakly present. No alcohol (20.3% ABV as marked on label) aroma or flavor, but massive numbing of the tongue and soft palate occurs as it warms while being held in the mouth. No alcohol on the exhale, oddly enough. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide, no hops.
Palate – 4 – Medium, just short of syrupy, lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4. Like the Chicxulub meteor, this burns all the way down my esophagus before striking my gastric mucosa, leaving a massive crater and wiping out all the helicobacter dinosaurs in my own, personal, mass extinction event. Otherwise, the flavors are subdued and blended to the point of making it difficult to separate individuals from the background salmagundi, providing a coherent and cogent synthesis of deep fruity flavors, sans wood or bourbon. Appearance is totally average: brown black, no head, but somehow looks less viscous than Old Engine Oil (of which I’ll soon be drinking sixers). Overall, a decent delivery system for high levels of alcohol. I capped the bottle while I can still make those decisions.",3.94

1671,Society & Solitude #4,"On tap at Arts and Craft Beer Parlor, NYC.
The color is redolent of freshly squeezed orange juice. Turbid in appearance with a layer of chill haze. No significant head, rather, minimal scattered bubbles on the surface, yet, there is lots of lacing throughout.
Intense hops driven aroma that highlights a varied bouquet of fruit and pungent herbal hops. In the 1st phase, there are notes of oranges, grapefruit, pear, and papaya. A light cracker malt aroma throughout. In the 2nd phase, herbaceous and dank notes of pine resin and grass.
The taste opens with a soft graham cracker malt sweetness accompanied by juicy notes of alcohol laced tropical, citrus and orchard fruit. Fruity and delicious flavors of grapefruit, orange, papaya, mango, peach and pear throughout. In the middle palate, a developing bitterness adds balance, along with notes of grass, pine resin and herbal dank. Furthermore, although juicy, the palate has dryness. Throughout the drink, the bitterness increases, as does the alcohol spice, to its credit, without booziness.
Medium to full bodied, gently carbonated and with a smooth mouthfeel, due perhaps to the addition of wheat and oats. The finish is dry and resiny with a lingering bitterness.
This is one of those beers in which the taste lingers in both the mouth and in the memory. I really hope to have it again sometime because it was wonderful.",4.65

It has a classic NEIPA appearance: turbid, muddy-golden in color with a large foamy bright white cap and abundant, thick, lacing. The nose features lemon, tangerine, grapefruit, peach, a whiff of vanilla, and light floral hops. Wow, is this delicious! It opens rather tart with lots of lemon and grapefruit notes, balanced by sweet tangerine and other hints of tropical fruit. At the finish of the sip there is a subtle but noticeable appearance of vanilla that becomes more apparent as the glass warms and gives it a creamsicle quality. The bill of Citra and Galaxy hops is very flavorful and only slightly bitter. It finishes with a touch of pepper. The mouth feel is superb: rich and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation, and the 8% ABV provides lots of substance. Overall, I'm believing the hype. S&S #4 is sensational!",4.57

FEEL: Smooth as silk. Slightly below average carbonation, and dry on the finish. Medium full body.

1718,Beatification,"Review 1544
I am a fan of Russian River, Pliny the Younger still eludes my taste buds. Living where I do, getting any beer worthy of writing home is difficult. I saw a bunch of Russian River's wild ales, I knew they had to come home with me. This is a sour beer aged in wine barrels. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a frothy white one-fingered head. The retention lasted maybe 15 seconds, leaving no lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 6, golden with amber hues. The beer is somewhat clear with a load of carbonation bubbles.
Initial aromas in the beer are wine, funky barn, straw, damp earth, and lemons. Nosing further, I detect toasted crackers, horse blanket, oak, a hint of floral, and a touch of herbal.",4.19

1728,Beatification,"At last got my hands on this RR classic! Golden orange with no head save a clear ring. Wonderful aromas of oak, wet earth, lemon, grass, hay, grapefruit zest, barrel must, and grains. Taste is more acidic and vinegar forward, but has all the same flavors from the smell, with an ending backed by sour oak and plenty of funk, but also leaves the palate pretty citrus sweet. Not the most complex, but plenty flavorful. Feel is tart, funky and has a vinegar artful harshness.",4.49
1729,Beatification,Look - very high carbonation and a clear pale yellow/straw color - stays quite active. Smell - decent amount of funk from 'spontaneous fermentation' - slight vinegar hint. Taste - pretty powerful blast of sourness and tart fruit - slight yeast and bread - some malt - mostly sour but backs off and other flavors come through then. Feel - medium bodied (which is a bit fuller than a typical barrel aged sour) and stays at a higher level of carbonation than expected. Overall - this is a great beer - I picked up this bottle in the original R.R. tap room in March 2019 - not as sour as I expected with a spontaneous fermented beer - a bit more complexity in this one as well - very enjoyable,4.25
1730,Beatification,"Got a bottle of this in July of 2017 when my best friend Jon and I visited the brewery when I went to visit him in northern California where he lives. This particular bottle was bottled on 2/15/17. Been holding onto this until tonight. Decided tonight is the night to finally drink this one. Poured out the bottle I just uncorked into my tulip glass, this beer pours a fairly cloudy/hazy light golden color with a good amount of little bubbles rising to the beer's surface. Has a nice white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that settles eventually to a medium sized ring lining the inside of the glass. Not much lacing here though. Aromas of some bready malts along with sour, musty, barnyard funk and oak notes along with a hint of citrus fruit. The taste follows suit, with some bready malts along with sour, musty, barnyard funk and oak notes along with a hint of citrus fruit and some green apple tartness. A very nice flavor profile overall indeed. Has a fairly crisp and slightly prickly, yet also smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Has a clean finish with a nice sour and slightly dry aftertaste. Very easy to drink in teh way well crafted beer ought to be.",4.3
1731,Beatification,"Pours a mostly clear straw yellow with a thin white head that disappeared quickly.
Smells a bit funky, oaky, light notes of fruit, lemon maybe some apple.

1734,Beatification,"I received this from @bum4ever in a BIF box. It was a ""mystery"" beer and my initial notes were made without knowing its identity. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. It pours a slightly hazy bright gold with orange hues. The effervescent, ecru-colored head dissipated quickly giving it a champagne-like appearance. It has the unmistakable smell of brett yeast, along with lemon and perhaps a hint of lime. There is also a distinct smell of oak. It's very fragrant. As expected, the taste opens strongly sour with bitter lemon notes. There is also a subtle taste of grape that gives it a small amount of balancing sweetness. As the glass warms you can increasingly taste the oak barrel and it finishes fairly bitter. The flavors blend very well. As expected for a Wild Ale, the feel is crisp and light with lively carbonation, and the 6% ABV doesn't distract from appreciation of the flavors. Overall, this is by far one of the finest Wild Ales I've had the pleasure to drink. Thank you, Josh, for the opportunity.",4.49
1735,Beatification,"2018 edition, poured into a tulip. A clear bright golden color with a modest white head that quickly settled. Crisp citrus aroma - lemon and orange. Some Brett funky esters and dough as well. The taste was phenomenal. Juicy citrus notes mixed with grassy, funky elements, doughy bread, and earthy elements. Moderately tart and very drinkable. The cherry on top was the elegant oaky presence throughout. Not overwhelming, but enough to easily notice. Exceptional.",4.49
1736,Beatification,"2017 vintage. Poured from fridge temp and allowed to warm. Pours a beautiful yellow with quickly dissipating white head. No sediment in the bottle. Nose is insane. A huge burst of citrus smacks you in the face. Lemon and orange primarily. A bit of pine, wheat, funk, and tartness. I can tell that this is going to be sour. Taste is as expected. Sour upfront, with a bitterness on the back end. Citrus peel really comes through, with a really nice earthy taste that runs throughout. Pine and a bit of leather are present. Mouthfeel is dry with good carbonation. Overall, a really nice example of the style. They always compete with the best.",4.38
1737,Beatification,"Pouring from a 375 ml. bottle into a tall wine glass. Bottle dated 3/01/18. This beer pours out light straw/lemon in color. And forms a thick white crown.

I am just really not coming out impressed with these Russian Rivers I have tried. I wish I was but it's just not adding up to me. I've had better sours than this. I want more complexity, more flavor. Idk just not adding up to me the ratings.",3.83

1755,Ephraim,"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a semi-hazy almost burnt orange color with a thin wisp of a white head that quickly dissipated. Light bubbles of broken head float around the top. Light wispy lacing. The smell takes in sweet danky onion sliding on into through resinous pine and then a light grapefruit underneath. The taste had a full bittersweet flavor revolving around the resinous piney part. Dry resinous aftertaste leads into a dry finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body. ABV, whoah, where did that go? Its not really there, well hidden. Overall, wow, just wow, just an absolutely stellar job by HF. I’d love to have this again.",4.71

This is definitely one of the best IPAs I've had the pleasure of tasting.",4.85
1763,Ephraim,"Expecting a bit more from this one. I expected the booziness given the 10% ABV but seem to be lacking in the aroma department. I enjoyed Abner earlier this week much more. Nonetheless, this is still a great beer. HF continues to produce high quality beers.",4.23
1764,Ephraim,"Big, beefy DIPA with a huge ABV that drinks incredibly easy. Hoppy, piney and floral aroma; taste of orange rind, mandarin orange, mango, apricot, grapefruit, tobacco and green tea. Outstanding citrus and bitter profile with a soft mouthfeel, but it's not a balanced beer - it's a big time hop-forward DIPA that comes on strong and doesn't let up. With a 10% ABV I'm not sure what else you could expect. Prepare your face. They've employed magic to make such a huge beer so palatable.",4.28
1765,Ephraim,"So. Damned. Creamy. The dextrose bumps up the body but doesn't make it syrupy. The appearance is pretty much perfect; bright auburn, perfect carbonation, sticky lacing.

1769,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours a thick pitch black. There was actually a 1 finger tan head on this beer. It didn't last too long, and there's no lacing on the glass.
The nose, well, it's a very strong nose. Very boozy smelling. Lots of caramel, and toffee. Raisin, and dates as well. I'm also getting just a fain hint of coffee.
Taste - Up front I get more of the dates and raisin. Tons of toffee, and that comes in on the backside, along with the caramel. Not really getting the coffee I was smelling.
This beer isn't as boozy feeling as I was expecting. That being said, this beer is so thick, and full bodied. It actually goes down so smooth.
World class stout, and so damn happy to try it.",4.85

Peanut brittle, marshmallow fluff, oaky vanilla, and light chocolate on the finish. Perfectly cohesive, perfectly cumbersome body, perfectly oxidized, and perfectly boozy.

Semi sweet caramel malt on entry, followed by molasses and a firm hop bitterness; raisins and plums, toffee middle; roasted nuts, a touch of old shoe leather and vanilla/oak notes on the backend. Medium full body, semi sticky feel; lite carbonation; slightly warming; smooth, silky tongue coating; dry oaky barrel finish.

Might be the best nose of any beer on the planet. Huge toffee and bourbon. Plums and figs. All of the notes are so pronounced. Nothing is being held back on this beer, which isn't surprising given the 13.5% ABV. Also picking up some yeast, vanilla, black currant, and sweet candy. I just can't stop smelling this beer! Taste is out of this world. Huge caramel smacks you in the face immediately upon sipping. Alcohol burns slightly on the back end. In the middle, there is a complex interaction between dark fruit (blackberries, currant, figs, cherries), bourbon, and nutty/bread flavors. I am just amazed by this beer. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, viscous, and chewy. Coats the mouth and lingers for a long time. Overall, one of the best beers I have tasted.

Still it is hoppy of the go and citrus bitter is the theme. Pithy hop burn pale ale bitter. Nice no juice bomb here. Follows the tradition of the pale ale well...Very nice and will definitely have again. I am lucky to be close to such an elite beer company

S: Aromas of lemon, white grapefruit, and nectarine appreciable over a corn and barley graininess.
T: Dry. Lemon is definitely the predominant fruit, with a grainy backbone. Well calibrated, peppery bitterness. Biscuity aftertaste.

1796,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"Can dated 10/19/20 poured into a tulip glass. Getting lots of tangerine/clementine and mango on the nose. The flavor is where this one took a weird turn for me - there was a strong vegetal flavor that overpowered everything for me through the mid and finish, kind of onion or garlic... or maybe some parsley (maybe that’s it because I’m not a big fan of parsley). Still really respectable, but not as tropical and fruity as I was expecting. Smooth finish, not too heavy or syrupy, with some lingering hoppy bitterness. This was can #1 of a 4 pack and has been stored cold the entire time, so I’ll definitely give it another shot and maybe see if it changes over time. Sadly, this one might just not be for me and not my fav DDH offering from Trillium.",3.88

1806,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"finally got my lips on this one, an extra hopped version of their now famous pale ale, and its predictably awesome. the thing about this, and about so many of the dry hoppy trillium beers really, is that they seem to know when to stop, and in some ways, i like this as much for what it isnt as i do for what it is. its not green and vegetal and forced, over saturated, harsh, or bitey, and that alone makes it better than so many others out there in this style right now. soft yellow even light greenish in color, its muted looking, thin, and nicely bubbly. it smells awesome, citra all over this, but not modern day citra, like citra when it first came into vogue and nobody could get enough of it, so distinctive and fresh, lemony and lemongrassy, with a beautiful freshness to it that almost is as relevant as the aroma it contributes. light green tea, a softly starchy but dry grain base, and a level of refinement evident that i am not used to in these. the flavor is as good as the nose, pineapple and honeydew and lemon zest all come to mind, but this isnt intense for all the dry hops it has, they seem so well integrated, not just on the surface but fundamental to what this is, and that is rare. light bitterness at the end but enough for this to appear balanced. awesome carbonation makes it feel really light, and the grain base is dry and simple but rustic enough to contribute something, and i really like that with the juicy hops in here. a really worthy beer, highly acclaimed and for good reason.",4.44

The beer is 42 degrees and served in an IPA glass. The pour created a frothy and airy two-fingered head with fair retention. The somewhat quick dissipation left some lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, pale gold with amber yellow hues. The beer has clarity, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing around.",4.41

T-picked up some crystal sweetness at first which was quickly overtaken by hop notes - not just citrus but also some stone fruits (El Dorado perhaps?) Finishes slightly dry with a pleasant residual bitterness. Definitely a lot of IBUS in this beer.
M-nice mouthfeel, some warming due to the 8% ABV. This is a sipper...

Smell - Lots of orange with some peach in there as well

1876,Haze,"Haze from Treehouse. Received on 9/4/21 from @Rub_This_BBQ in NBW BIF #13. 12 oz can stored upside-down at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 16/4/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Undated can. Served at 42.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 53.4 degrees.
Appearance – 4.25.
First pour – Pale Straw (SRM 2), murky and nearly opaque.
Body – Straw (SRM 3), murky and opaque. When rear-lite, same.
Head – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), floral white, high density, average retention, diminishing to a two to four mm crown and a thick partial cap. As the head collapses, multiple fragments of bands of lacing remain above the crown. Second pour produces a high density 0.5 cm head.
Lacing – Good. Head retraction and volume reduction leaves a wide band of tiny to medium bubbles. See also above.
Aroma – 4.25 – Pineapple followed by pine. No malt, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.5 – Begins moderately dank with some generic tropical fruit in the background yet somehow refreshing. No malt, no yeast. No alcohol (8.2 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. A weak gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 4.5 – Medium, creamy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 (After deducting 0.25 point for undated personal container) Pleasing aroma and flavor, smooth and refreshing on the palate.",4.38
1877,Haze,"Can @ Monkish. Cloudy golden-orange beer with a finger of soapy white foam. Nice tropical fruits (mostly pineapple), pine, and oily citrus on the nose to start. There’s a bit of underlying sweetness here, but it’s fairly mild. The flavor starts off with a lot of citric hop character such as grapefruit and orange, but there’s a pretty strong pineapple juice thing going on, too. Moderate bitterness and a slightly oily finish. Kind of heavy on the tongue.",3.75
1878,Haze,"For an IPA the smell and taste cannot get any better. A lot of Treehouse beers fade into memory as tasting a lot alike, great stuff but not individually memorable. However, Haze is such a unique standout. The ability to make hops taste both of peach and hops is amazing. By far my favorite Treehouse beer.",4.95
1879,Haze,"Every TH beer seems to blend into each other. That’s what happens when the same yeast is in every beer. That being said, that means every product is solid. Haze...has a distinction. Really good, hazy style, but has a slight WC finish and bite. My favorite IPA I have ever had.",4.86
1880,Haze,"16oz can received as a gift from a friend. Purchased directly from the brewery. Canned on 9/30/2020 with ""I Want Haze You Want Haze We All Want Haze"" stamped on the bottom, so this is almost 3 months old.",3.79

1882,Haze,"Hazy yellow with a bubbly foam on top. Some spotty lacing down the sides of the glass. Orange citrus aromas highlight a soft nose, just a touch of hoppy resin and booze detectable as well. The flavor has a lot of complexity going on with lightly fruity flavors. The can describes peach and papaya flavors, as well as orange juice and there's no arguing with that. There is also a mild hop bitterness that just takes the edge of the sweet flavors so expertly. All those flavors are nestled into a medium carbonation and full body and create a balanced and extremely pleasant experience. Incredibly enjoyable to sip on and reflect on just how expertly crafted this beer is.",4.35
1883,Haze,"Murky medium blonde forming a modest white head wit good retention. Moderate carbonation. Nose is dank with pine, grapefruit, pineapple, marijuanna, cat pee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit chewy. The taste is a recap of the aroma. Firm bitterness. I had this back to back with the green and honestly I couldn't tell the difference even with my eyes open. The smell, flavor, mouthfeel seemed the exact same to me.",4.24
1884,Haze,"Did the children have a good week in Mantucket? Was it a long ferry and drive back? Was there too much going on unloading the car and getting the kids into bed and putting stuff away? Thanks, Haze. Solid straw gold look, with a 1/4” head on a soft pour and 3/4” with a second hard pour in a tulip glass. Lacy foam coating the glass during the 2nd overtime Dallas win! Nice citrus and sweet flavors coming through, passion fruit or papaya. The hops barely comes through and nicely controlled. The aroma is ne dipa all the way, citrus, peachy, papaya, mango. Nice finish, on the drier side. Double ipa? You would never know it, not boozy and immensely drinkable!",4.5

1886,Haze,"Canned on 8/7/2020, almost a month old which is fine by me. Orange, peach, candy aromas, juicy as hell. Citrus flavor, bit of minerals, tasty. Overall I like the aroma more than the flavor but this is a good one.",4.13
1887,Haze,"Nose of fruit and slight piney hops.
Taste initially is a lot of orange juice/fruit flavor finished with a light hop bitterness. Very smooth and light and crushable for the abv. Solid but no exceptional",3.94
1888,Haze,"LOOKS: Opaque, and a burnt orange like the rest. White foam that sticks around and leaves a thick lacing down the glass.
AROMA: Large tropical notes. Sweet white dough. Little bit dank, too.
TASTE: The sweetest TH brew that I've tried. Some oj, and papaya. Mild bitterness that doesn't last. Lots of tropical goodies.
FEEL: A bit creamy up front and then quite dry on finish. Bordering on full body with about average carbonation.
OA: Least favorite of the bunch that I've had. That sweetness lingers; not a big fan of that. Otherwise, big hop notes again, and flavorful.",4.56

T: Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon heat, oak. Roasted malt, date/fig, brown sugar, black licorice notes.
F: medium, slight bourbon burn.
Overall: not overly complex. The biggest feat is making this 20% beast without it being a burny booze bomb, which it does very very well. I’ve had 10% beers that felt more filling and/or boozy.
This is about 4 years old and has the vanilla and cocoa so maybe that has helped even more.",4.52

750 ml bottle, 2017, poured into a tulip",4.64
1894,Chocolate Rain,"2016 release - consumed on November 12, 2020.
Pours a very dark brown. 1 finger off white head. For the ABV, the retention is good. The head dissipates to a ring around the edge of the glass. There's some decent carbonation rising in the glass that makes the ring swirl about. No lacing on the glass.
The nose is a sweet toffee aroma from the barrels. I do get a chocolate and vanilla undertone.
Taste - Like the nose tons of toffee. The chocolate is really muted. I don't know if it would be stronger fresh. The chocolate and vanilla are on the backside.
Very boozy, which isn't surprising. Even aged 4 years, very ""hot"". It isn't as thick as I was expecting.
This is an interesting beer. good, but you know it's very strong, and must be slowly enjoyed.",4.26
1895,Chocolate Rain,"Boy oh boy. You take an already infamous beer and up the ante by adding vanilla and cocoa. Gnarly. It's a beastly beer that is a true sipper if Ive ever seen one. It's rich, dark, heavy, sweet and delicious. The addition of cocoa and vanilla add flavor to a beer that, honestly, didnt really need any help but somehow serves as an upgrade. Great beer, share it with good friends, dont drive afterward.",4.54
1896,Chocolate Rain,"WOW!!! Just tasted this on tap at Brewski in Brisbane. One of the truly great stouts, IMO. Would have loved to try it alongside CBS, my favorite other stout to date. I would try to expand on this but words cannot do justice to such great beer.",4.75
1897,Chocolate Rain,"2016 bottling.
A lot of barrel in the nose, along with vanilla.
Still a lot off booziness in this one. Plenty of vanilla and a slight bitterness from the cacao nibs.
Thick mouthfeel, a zipper for sure!
A big boy imperial stout not to be taken lightly! A great beer.",4.34
1898,Chocolate Rain,I like this variant. Maybe better than the base beer.,4.2
1899,Chocolate Rain,"This is one of the finest imperial stouts. Tastes like prunes and chocholate with not too much sweetness. It also ages really well. Mouthfeel is think, but not too thick, and the ABV is off the charts.",4.68
1900,Chocolate Rain,"On tap at Bruery Terreux in Anaheim, CA.",4.62
1901,Chocolate Rain,"Pours black withi a still, oily look to it. Head foams up to a finger in height, but disappears quickly. Foam is khaki in color. Aroma is booze from the moment the wax-covered bottle cap is cracked open. In addition to heavy booze (via bourbon) is chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, molasses, coffee and roasty, toasty malts. There is a hint of char at the finish. Flavor profile follows suit, with sugary notes of chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, molasses, caramel and brown sugar mingling with lightly bitter notes of roasty, toasty malts, coffee and char. Booze and bourbon is present throughout, adding a substantial level of heat even after aging the bottle for a couple years. Alcohol turns the finish to dry, rinsing away the initial sweetness. Mouth feel is thick and full, but with a rather still texture. Overall, heavy, filling and with plenty of heat. It's a bottle worth sharing, but sparingly.",4.1
1902,Chocolate Rain,2015. 18.4% ABV.,4.45

1904,Chocolate Rain,"02/2015 - 2013 vintage - Wow, this is exactly what I wanted from this Black Tuesday variant; the chocolate takes it to the next level - big fan! The mouthfeel is even better, too.",4.44
1905,Chocolate Rain,"Carbonation was a bit low with pour head retention. Not what I have seen with the other black Tuesday varients. Otherwise this is basically black Tuesday with the chocolate notes turned up to 11, which is not a bad thing.",4.49
1906,Chocolate Rain,"Pouring a 2017 bottle from a 750 ml. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer, just like Black Tuesday, pours out way lighter in color than expected when pouring a stout of this nature. Medium-dark brown color with highlights all the way through. On the pour, as quick as bubbles could form they would pop. Eventually the carbonation got ahead of the disippation and formed a thinner light tan crown. The smell is quite demanding and confident with booze and alcohol. It burns the nostrils and honestly doesn't leave much else to show you along the way. The taste comes in more inviting, showing you smooth chocolate and vanilla, while still having a rather pronounced burn. I do enjoy the thickness of the body to these but I will say that I wish this and Black Tuesday were both more complex. They really aren't blowing me away. I get it, it's impressive they made a 20% stout blah blah blah, but I still want it to have complexity and blow me away. And these just haven't been.",3.69

1910,Chocolate Rain,"Mixed opinion. Have been waiting to try this for years. Bought 3 and will try out over at least 9 Years. Beer #1: Beer had outstanding nose and flavor, and is easily considered an excellent beer. Appearance was fine and head/lacing consistent with an almost 20% ABV. Very disappointed in mouthfeel... had expected something full and rich and instead a bit hot (understand), very thin (don’t understand) and even a touch astringent. Hard to believe it’s a Double IS. Almost a mix of Black Tuesday, Vanilla, nibs... and Sang Noir.
It’s not going to get any thicker or creamier... so much less excited about aging. A very delicious beer... just not my style for body.",4.44
1911,Chocolate Rain,"Reviewed on 10/1/17, from notes
2017 vintage
L - Pours deep toffee color with a thin khaki head.
S - The aroma is very similar to Black Tuesday. Lots of bourbon and ethanol. Also lots of dark fruits. I only get hints of chocolate, vanilla, and char.
T - The flavors are typical bourbon notes; vanilla, oak, char, and hints of caramel. There are sweet chocolate undertones throughout. But there is a big ethanol bitter finish.
F - Thin body, but a little sticky
O - I'm a little disappointed. The overall experience is good, but doesn't knock my socks off. That ethanol finish was a killer. This is a relatively fresh bottle and it could just use some age.",4.61

Has plenty of vibrant fruit like the original: grapefruit, lime, nectarine, orange, peach, with accenting lemon with dank and dry hops. Taste adds some mango yet the hops remain pretty dank and full yet finish dry and clean, impressive. Feel is about as good as it gets, hops are more than a one trick dry pony yet finish is bone dry, great hazy fruit, perfectly balanced and crisp. Better than the orignal",4.54

L: More banana-orange juice. Minimal thick little head.
S: oranges and stonefruit
T: Same with Nice bitter bite.
F: Juicy to the point of AI level. Aside from bitterness still crushable and not filling.
Overall: juicy and fresh wet hoppy to the point of laughable. Both versions don’t have much head. I’m not sure how much to ding them. Overall impressive, would recommend to any fan of hop+juice+bitter bombs.",4.54

1930,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,"Opaque orange so I'm told - I'm color blind but my wife and sister in law swear it looks like orange juice.
It smells like what nostalgia tells me Five Alive smelled like: overwhelmingly citrus with heavy orange and tangerine notes.

It's as hoppy as you'd expect a double dry hopped ipa to be, but super juicy with citrus throughout.",4.64

1935,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,"10/21/19, from a can released late September (~3 weeks old): 'Taste' rating upped from 4.25 to 4.5 for a touch more creaminess at the front of the palate, and some incense/onion/herbal hop tones further accentuating the back end. Balanced to the point of understatement, but enabling a level of universal approachability few NEIPAs reach (especially with a DDH treatment); this beer sits casually at the peak of the style, with few others as level or refined.",4.5

Orange-pineapple juice. It's good but that's what it is...not much complexity.

What an epic beer. Seems easy to make a heavily-hopped IPA but it doesn’t seem easy to make a TIPA (TRIPA?) because it’s so massive. I’ve seen a few other Triple IPAs and this tops ‘em all. Hazy, proper head, beautiful color. Plenty of booze in the nose but it’s inviting, sweet, and rather malty. The aroma carries over to the flavor, but the masterful hop bill really shows throughout, especially in the feel and finish. Sooooo smooth, perfectly sweet yet hoppy, and the right body. Balance makes this a stellar beer but a world-class IPA (cubed). And a 4-pack for $15 at the brewery is a damn steal!",4.77
1961,Triple Sunshine,"12 oz can: This one pours a hazy darker orangish golden color. A wisp of a white head and almost no lacing. Good nose. Resinous pine, citrus and tropical hop notes. The taste is very good. Somewhat bitter with an underlying thicker sweetness. Resinous pine, citrus and tropical flavors. Maybe some honey and biscuit also. Very nice.",4.43
1962,Triple Sunshine,"Probably the best/smoothest of the triple IPAs that I’ve had. With that said, the style itself is a bit over the top for my preference. The booze overpowers everything else. Some flavors of overripe peaches and white grapefruit but the booze washes over everything and lingers. Some residual sweetness with the boozy aftertaste. Overall probably the top of the class for this style but the style isn’t my preference.",3.85
1963,Triple Sunshine,LAWSONS TRIPLE SUNSHINE TIPA 5/30/19,4.74
1964,Triple Sunshine,"Canned 3/27/19. Pours a mild golden hue with a thin head into my glass. Strong hop punch in the nose with pineapple and grapefruit. Extremely bitter with grapefruit, pineapple and lychee making their presence known in the mouth. Acidic finish that reminds one to sip, not quaff. At 10.3%, it's stronger than most IPAs and if you like your IPAs on the lower side of the spectrum, you may not enjoy this. I do though. Well worth it.",3.96
1965,Triple Sunshine,canned 02/19/19,4.24
1966,Doppelganger,"Pours a hazy orange yellow color with a medium bodied but sticky white colored head that laces the glass on the way down. Smells of a treehouse - sweet toasted malts and then citrus and floral hop aromas to finish off the nose. The taste is sweet toasted malts, and then floral and hops finish off with a grapefruit taste. It's smooth, real silky, medium bodied, perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, good beer.",4.25
1967,Doppelganger,Pours more like a west coast IPA with a dank nose. Surprising mild flavor with super smooth finish. This is really a nice beer and super juicy. Very good.,4.63
1968,Doppelganger,Pours a hazy dirty straw color with over a finger of head. The nose is predominantly dank with some piney notes in the background. The flavor has notes of orange juice and grapefruit juice with a pithiness on the finish.,4.22
1969,Doppelganger,"Pours a hazy medium straw color, abundant foamy head that lasts. Huge hoppy aroma, loads of overripe mango, massive pineapple, dank guava. Some citrus as well. Remarkable. Very flavorful. Loads of ripe tropical fruits mix with pithy citrus notes. Very juicy, semi sweet with no bitterness. Good carbonation. Overall an excellent DIOA. Would buy again.",4.46
1970,Doppelganger,"Canned 2/15/21, ""I have read a book about me reading the book I am reading"" stamped on the bottom",4.4
1971,Doppelganger,A: Pours a hazy golden orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a decent cap that leaves good lacing,4.58
1972,Doppelganger,"Pours hazy straw yellow, two fingers of head that recedes slowly with lots of lacing.",3.98
1973,Doppelganger,"Can @ Monkish. Cloudy copper beer with some white foam. This one still has a pretty dank, oily, resinous hop character but is a bit more well composed, as compared to its little brother, Alter Ego. Plenty of citrus, some pine, and a bit of tropical fruits. Definitely a bit of malt sweetness here, and some sweetness of pineapple and peach. A nice enough offering.",3.81
1974,Doppelganger,"Imperial IPA with all the trappings of a hazy NEIPA (that’s a GOOD thing). That haze is the first thing you encounter and it’s creamy orangey hue is very inviting. Like most Treehouse ales, the nose is just a delight. All the expected notes of citrus, pine and tropical fruit are there with a just subtle earthy dankness. The palate follows suit with more of that glorious funk and some subtle vanilla & caramel notes. Finishes so nicely you want another immediately.",4.58
1975,Doppelganger,"16 oz can split with a friend, poured into a snifter. An OJ and tropical fruit bomb with a noticeable but not cloying malt backbone. Just a hint of pine to add complexity. Impeccably smooth and pillowy mouthfeel with no trace of alcohol despite the 8.2% abv. Overall a truly stellar (D)NEIPA from TH.",4.53
1976,Doppelganger,"Thanks for the share Bryan! This is just another in a long line of Tree House IPA I have thoroughly enjoyed. Flavor, aroma and mouthfeel top notch!!",4.25
1977,Doppelganger,Poured from a 16oz can into a pub glass.,4.75
1978,Doppelganger,"LOOKS: Very burnt orange, with a finger of white foam that sticks around, and leaves a pretty thick lacing.
AROMA: Can is 3 weeks old. Lots of big tropical notes. White bread dough. A little dank weed. Basically tropical fruit juice, with a nice big helping of o.j. Smells fantastic!
TASTE: Everything from the aroma just more intense. I get that bread dough quality. A slight bitterness that fades quickly. Just massive, clean, fruit juice.
FEEL: Creamy up front, and dry on the finish. Well carbonated, and full bodied.
OA: Perfect!",5
1979,Doppelganger,"As Tree House indicates, Doppelgänger is an imperial version of Alter Ego - which I think of is a cousin to their flagship beer, Julius. So, you could think of Doppelgänger as a second cousin to Julius.
Darker and a little danker than some of their other IPAs. Great smell. The mouthfeel is what really won me over. Heavier than Jukius, in a good way. Great beer.",4.4
1980,Doppelganger,"Look... i mean ""damn the sh%t looks like juice"" what neipas look like
Smell...this is where TH just kicks the sh#t out of most comp on the shelf and most off the shelf. hearty hop smell with the tree yeast scheme .dank
Taste...full, yeast, body,swet to bitter fall away jump shot in your grill hop burn...yummy
Feel...slippery abruptness as it lifts the pallet back to juice bitterness Def taste that alter ego presence with a big boy finish...
Overall....top notch do not ever turn one down because you would be foolish....
Seriously this TH beer is great",4.61
1981,Doppelganger,"Myself and 3 kids started a bike trek towards the minuteman trail. Youngest one takes a spill at minute 15, knees and elbows. We trudge on. Oldest flats her tire at minute 45. In 90 degree sweltering weather, we have to walk it back. My partner drives by but can only fit 3 of the bikes. So, I in my lonesome pedal back to the house, (uphill both ways of course) knowing that I’ve been saving this beer for an occasion just like this. The four of them are up in the house, and I, in my lonesome, pulled out the folding beach chair in the backyard and popped open Doppelgänger in the shade. Fruity citrus aroma popping out of the can. Great balance on the hops, with the bitterness controlled. Simply refreshing in the mouth. Maybe I drank this a little too quickly.",4.82
1982,Doppelganger,Thanks Adam! 16oz canned 6/17 poured into a tulip - my second Tree House brew ever.,4.54
1983,Doppelganger,Poured from 16oz tall can into a tulip. Canned on 6/17/20. My first Tree House beer!,4.4
1984,Doppelganger,"Sweet, slightly malty, hint of orange/tangerine citrus, and sweet, piney-dank pineapple nose on this one! Ha! Taste follows with a malty-sweet, orange citrus bitterness that's subtle...then a piney dank vibe takes over the bitter bite. The bitterness on the swallow is a creeper...very subdued and then it lingers and quietly increases until you notice it on the back of the throat. This is an easy drinker and is soft on the palate. This is really good!",4.55
1985,Doppelganger,"Thanks Nick for the can! Sumptuous hazy body with a frothy white head, lacing, decent carbonation. Sharp pine and dank hops fill the nose, with peach, papaya, grapefruit, melon, orange and lemon zest. Taste stars the hops through out the sip, yet never gets resinous or heavy, great bitters, pine, dankness, and zesty pith with the fruits backing up quickly but not super defined. Feel is a technical clinic of the neipa, juicy haze and sharps perfectly defined hops crashing into each other with glorious results. Dankness, pine, juice, pith, and a mouth watering dryness, just wish it was longer lived on the palate. Great beer",4.42
1986,Doppelganger,Got this as part of a pack as I was in line with many many autos. Didn’t really know this beer but am SO glad it came with beers that I was relatively familiar with. Smooth. Just wonderful. If it’s availability the next time I am able to get to Tree house I will get more and MORE.,4.63
1987,Doppelganger,"Another really nice offering from Tree House. Compared with its relatives, I enjoyed this more than Alter Ego, but less than Aaalterrr Ego (sorry if I missed a few letters in there) or Alter Ego w/ Peach. A nice balanced NEDIPA that's got a good amount of hop bite and plenty of juicy character to balance it out. It's easy to get blasé about Tree House's IPA-style beers because they're so darn good - this really is an excellent beer, but there are also 10 or 12 TH beers in the same style that I prefer.",4.5
1988,Doppelganger,"Juicy, dank and delicious.",4.64
1989,Doppelganger,"Used a tulip Duval glass. Approximately one inch of head that faded leaving some nice lacing. Smell is an abundance of citrus. Taste is dry piney tangerine with a nice after taste that lingered. Feel is medium to full bodied.
Overall another exceptional IPA variation.",4.24
1990,Doppelganger,"Incredible beer. Been looking for this one for a while and obtained this one fresh from the brewery. 3/5/20 date printed on can. Pours a beautiful hazy yellow-orange color with fluffy white head and some small soapy rings of lingering lacing. Smells of fresh papaya, melon, mango, pineapple, grapefruit and orange. Also some malt, creamy vanilla, bread and weaker floral hops. Some nice dankness in there as well. Taste follows the nose, and I appreciated the dankness that isn't always present in Tree House's other NE style IPAs. Juicy, easy to drink, high ABV very well hidden. Smooth, creamy, soft mouthfeel, great carbonation. So well done!",4.5
1991,Keene Idea,11/2/2020 Can thanks to the generosity of Original_Gravity #246 of the BA Top 250,4.42
1992,Keene Idea,Can from last week's release. Been after this beer for a long time.,4.54

1994,Keene Idea,"16oz can, dated 08.05.19, poured into a 14oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 08.25.19, reviewed from Tasting Journal.",4.33
1995,Keene Idea,Finally was able to track this one down thanks to good beer friends! Definitely one of Alpines best! Nice citrus notes and a solid hoppy finish. Enjoyed the 64 oz growler with friends at a Bachelor party share.,4.66
1996,Keene Idea,fresh growler drank on 8/3/2017,4.5
1997,Keene Idea,"Love the hops in this one, which is easily one of Alpine's best. The only bad thing about Keene Idea is that they (to my knowledge) haven't bottled it yet. I would stock up like crazy!",4.57
1998,Keene Idea,"This beer is awesome, wish they would bottle it so I could have it all the time. Loved this beer and going to Alpine is a great brewery to visit. The nicest guys ever there. Looking forward to this being released again",4.75
1999,Keene Idea,"Stone fruit and juiciness on the nose give way to grapefruit citrus flavor and some dank , with slight bitterness. One of best DIPAs I've had and Alpine's best IMO",4.64
2000,Keene Idea,Had on Tap at Hopocalyse Day 1/23/16,4.31
2001,Keene Idea,"From growler. Pours a slightly hazy copper orange. Multi finger foam head with reasonable retention. Solid lacing. Smells of good, clean, hop fun. Bitter and earthy smell. A nice, more simple, great tasting beer. Bitter pine that makes way to a hint of fresh grapefruit. Smooth feel with strong carbonation and an assertive hop stick. Best ipa I've tried from these guys, thus far.",4.59
2002,Keene Idea,"Pours a burnt orange color with a thick white head that dissipates some throughout drinking. Solid lacing on the glass. Nice tropical smell on the nose with some of the nelson character as well. Taste reflects that soft citrus flavor with nice bitterness shining through. Great, smooth mouthfeel that you look for with the upper echelon IPA class. Best IPA offering from these guys in my opinion",4.58
2003,Keene Idea,Just had the Keene Idea for the first time today.. Went to get Nelsons.. Now I want Keene Idea.. The same Nelson Hops used here. Little more Boozy than the Nelson but still so so drinkable and absolutely my new best from Alpine !,4.98
2004,Keene Idea,"Poured from 64oz growler into tulp crystal clear orange in color with white head that vanished quickly. (I believe because i didnt get to open it soon enough) smells of tropical fruit, pineapple and citrus. Ice lacing and great tasting beer at a 8.8%. Piney and hoppy! Would like to get some bottle to beable to get the full flavor. Im a Nelson guy myself but another great IPA from Alpine",4.43
2005,Keene Idea,"32oz ABC growler, served in a snifter glass 9/30/2015.",4.49
2006,Keene Idea,"Deep copper color with a fingernail of off white around the rim. The aroma is piney and honey sweet. I taste a massive amount of piney hops. The mouth is thick, chewy, and overall dense.",4.15
2007,Keene Idea,"Very nice aroma and blend of hops, remarkably smooth for a 9%. The higher alcohol content is not very noticeable, but can be noticeable if you let it warm up, so definitely drink it chilled. This is probably my favorite IPA by Alpine with bad boy a close second.",4.68
2008,Keene Idea,64 oz. growler poured into a snifter.,4.2
2009,Keene Idea,Pours and orange hazy color with moderate head retention. Smells very citrusy with some mango notes. Tastes a lot of grapefruit with this beer with a moderate bitter finish. Moderate mouth feel with perfect carbonation for this beer. Another excellent Alpine offering.,4.72
2010,Keene Idea,"Not quite as good as Bad Boy, but different and special in its own way. Another example of the great SoCal IPAs that have a lot of hops but still make them drinkable and enjoyable.",4.6
2011,Keene Idea,"The one and only time I've made the pilgrimage to Alpine Beer, this was on tap. I had no idea what it was and in hindsight I consider myself a lucky man for being able to drink a pint of this my first time there. I will absolutely be on the lookout for when they tap it again. Absolutely incredible IPA.",4.91
2012,Keene Idea,This is like Nelson on crack. So delicious. Barely noticeable ABV. One Alpine beer you know you're getting from their production and not Green Flash. Must try. Another winner from Alpine.,4.8
2013,Keene Idea,"Like liquid hop candy, yet with a basic enough malt base to never veer off into syrupy sweet territory. Arguably the best beer Alpine puts out, and that's saying something.",4.65
2014,Keene Idea,So freaking good! Not as good as Bad Boy but the dry hop on this beer is so amazing. Has that cloudy ipa look that I love and it so smooth and drinkable. I wish I could have a tap of this straight from Alpine in my house.,4.81
2015,Keene Idea,"Alpine's litmus test to me involved having Keene Idea (originally Toronado's 25th Anniversary beer) on a beer list already with outstanding beers. I prefer not to use tasters because I like to soak up a greater experience with a given beer, so after a round a Nelson, Keene Idea had a high mark to hit. On to the beer:",4.6

2022,Black Note Stout,"Such a fantastic beer. 2017 vintage, so about 26 months old. Standard stout appearance-dark, mild tannish lacing. Smell is roasty malt and a strong barrel presence. Taste is amazing. Perfect balance of dark malt and woody bourbon barrel. Notes of chocolate, espresso, dark fruitiness. Medium bodied, mouth watering, big booziness. Was a longtime want, and glad it’s an absolute winner.",4.7
2023,Black Note Stout,Bottled 10/5/17,5
2024,Black Note Stout,"2017 vintage. I have had this one sitting around for a while. Pours a dense jet black color with no light coming through. Surprisingly good size (medium) dark tan head. Filmy tan lacing on the glass. Rich malty aroma and flavor. A little a coffee, some chocolate. not much of the bourbon, but definitely some oak that adds a touch of bitterness to he mildly sweet flavor. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Some warming alcohol presence but no ""bite"". Goes down very easy. This is a top shelf stout!!!!",4.19
2025,Black Note Stout,"2017 vintage, served just above fridge temp in a warm room, got a pretty wide variety of tastes and smells as it warmed up.",4.21
2026,Black Note Stout,2016 12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. This beer has aged well to this point. Tons of chocolate in the flavor with some touches of espresso contributing to a slightly dry finish. Black Note is a beer I'll continue to seek whenever available.,4.6
2027,Black Note Stout,"12oz bottle 2017
L nice thick deep black but even with aggressive pour little to no head or lacing

2033,Black Note Stout,"I just had the 2017 Black Note Stout and it was great. It's hard to get where I live so I was happy to finally get my hands on it. What a wonderful stout, full bodied and flavorful and yet smooth and easy drinking. It is truly delicious.",4.7
2034,Black Note Stout,"Pours so dark it is completely impervious to light. 2 fingers of mocha head slowly fade. Really great chocolate and bourbon aroma, fairly typical yet exceptional. Great chocolate flavor, very intense, bourbon barrel smooths it out and gives it a really nice barrel flavor. Tons of dark roasted malt flavor. Light bitter espresso finish. Full bodied, rich, thick, and creamy. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall an outstanding BBA Imperial Stout, worth buying a few if you come across it.",4.54
2035,Black Note Stout,"This one required at least four months bottle aging to round off the heat. But after that it's a mighty fine brew.
Oak, vanilla, and rich medjool dates complement this wonderful stout.",4.5
2036,Black Note Stout,Reviewing this after having it about 2 months ago.,4.14
2037,Black Note Stout,"Finally found this beer in a bottle at a grocery store in NYC on 75th and 2nd. I think its good, but not as unbelievable as some of the ratings indicate. The malt taste is solid, and definitely worth drinking, but I've tasted better amongst newer releases (Prison Double Barrel Wham Whams, Other Half 5th, etc.)",4.35
2038,Black Note Stout,"2017 12oz bottle poured cold to a tulip glass. Dark mahogany brown with a two-finger bubbly mocha head. Lots of lacing that clings and doesn’t move, at all. Nose is faint vanilla and char, very subdued compared to what I thought it would be. First sips are woody, creamy stout, with a slight bourbon back-end linger. Very balanced flavor profile, with only a slight woody bite in the front. It’s almost like drinking “black.” Yeah, that sounds trippy, but it’s almost like not drinking anything other than a concept. It’s full, creamy, warming, filling. No alcohol presence, but it is warming. Very smooth, very easy to drink. I’m half-way through it, and am sad that it’s almost gone, with only one more on the shelf.",4.42
2039,Black Note Stout,"12oz bottle. 2017 bottling (10/05/017).
Dark brown colored body, with the bottom edge displaying a backlit medium brown. Initial two finger tan head settles back to thick cap with varying bubble sizes (looks creamy). Leaves behind an interrupted pattern of lacing spots and strings.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, dark fruit, and oak bourbon barrel.
Taste of dark roasted malts, which translates to dark chocolate, dark fruit, toffee/molasses, and a touch of espresso. The oak bourbon barrel is present but is a quiet blend to the other components. Minimal bitterness. The aftertaste is like bourbon soaked prunes and figs.
Mouth coating, medium plus mouth feel. Has a smooth texture. Good carbonation which supports the body.
I am pleasantly surprised by the balance and blend of the beer. It has breadth and depth but is also easy to drink. The barrel note is supportive but not overly intrusive. Warming throughout the imbibing process.",4.51
2040,Black Note Stout,Phenomenal. Near perfect Drinkability and finish. This beer is smooth and perfectly balanced. You will not get a traditional place punchbof hops like most imperial stouts and that is not a bad thing.,4.79
2041,Flora Plum,"After Flora Pear, this is my favorite Flora. Excellent barrel character has been imparted into the beer. Pours a beautiful deep gold, big wine nose, effervescent with plums dancing in the background. Fantastic.",4.74
2042,Flora Plum,"Pours a straw gold. Nose of plum, Lemon, hay, and traditional HF nose. Taste follows with a well blended plum, lemon, hay, minimal acid. Feel is light/medium with medium carb. Overall, this is an excellent fruit beer that is well balanced with the base beer.",4.51

2049,Flora Plum,2018 release.,4.44
2050,Flora Plum,"03/2016 - I want to like this more but the nose is just unpleasant to me - it smells like plastic, basically. Thankfully, the palate is chock full of plum, nice oakiness, juicy fruit, with a touch of tartness in back; the finish is creamy, tart, and has a solid acidity.",3.97
2051,Flora Plum,Poured from a 375mL bottle into a HF bulb. Batch 2. Thanks Ryan for sharing this.,4.74
2052,Flora Plum,375 ml bottle poured into a teku at a share.,4.71
2053,Flora Plum,"This is probably the best Hill Farmstead beer ive had. It takes Floras great base beer and blends perfectly with the plums to create a something amazing. Id drink one of these a day if i could, it was that good.",5
2054,Flora Plum,"poured from a 375mL bottle into a perennial wine glass. pours the color of ruby red grapefruit juice with some soapy white head which dies down to form a white collar around the glass. smells of fresh plums, lemons and grapefruit plus oak and a tinge of white wine. it has a much livelier acidic nose than most HF. taste is citrus and plum with lemon and oak. not really sour at all. refreshing and super easy and enjoyable to drink. mouthfeel is full with a nice amount of carbonation. not overly so but enough to give it a lively spritziness. overall, the best fruited flora i’ve had and one of my favorite HF saisons.",4.58
2055,Flora Plum,"I had the great fortune of sharing a bottle of Flora Plum with a close friend when visiting Cape Cod in the summer of 2018. Quite possibly the best sour I've had. Beautiful color and such delicate flavors, worth the money (which was substantial, I think this was the most expensive glass of beer I've been lucky enough to enjoy), truly spectacular.",5
2056,Flora Plum,"Batch 1: Bright gold pour, light haze, smaller head that fizzles out fast. amazing balance in the aroma and taste here. Slightly under-ripe yellow plum, rustic notes, wheat, barnyard funk, lemon notes, lighter oak notes, light vanilla sweetness, light yogurt lactic sourness. Nothing here exhausts the palate - no one component completely takes over this beer. Lighter body, carbonation is spot on.",4.63
2057,Flora Plum,"Received in a trade, shared with JLindros.",4.25
2058,Flora Plum,"Bottled 1/12/2016. Pours a pale, hazy yellow with a tight white band around the shoulders. Nose expresses citrus, plum skins and a hint of spice. Not too much happening in the flavor department - must with a little citrus. Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild carbonation and light acidity. Overall, solid; however, not much fruit is evident.",4.01

2061,Flora Plum,Flora Plum batch 2,3.81
2062,Flora Plum,"Juicy ripe plums picked and appropriately timed to perfection in this beer. Incredible nectar and plenty of gleeky-sourness to it without the harsh finish, very smooth on the way down. This is hands down one of the very best fruited saisons I've ever had the pleasure to try. The pour is a hazy yellow trillium ipa with minimal lacing around the edge of the glass. Aroma is intense with fruit, something unique about the funk... it's not overwhelming but reminds me for some reason of a Russian River sour. The way the sweetness lingers through the finish and the smooth mouthfeel ends with no puckering, this thing is awesome.",4.63
2063,Flora Plum,Bottle shared by Curran on my wedding day- thanks a ton man.,4.64
2064,Flora Plum,"My first HF Flora variant. And while I'm admittedly not that big into plums, I still found this to be an enjoyable brew. I'm glad I had this during summer, it was very refreshing.",4.19
2065,Flora Plum,"This is head and shoulders above the other Flora variants and among HF's best saisons. Had both batches at a recent tasting. Both are excellent, but batch 1 had a flavor that had burned in and integrated, and a bit more funk that put it over the top. Seek out.",4.74
2066,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"On tap at Cardinal’s big Brewers’ Night, Pitch black colour, moderate tan head. Intense aroma of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate and oak. Sweet flavour with nearly overwhelming notes of vanilla, also roasted malts, coffee and chocolate, bourbon and oak again, but the hops are very moderate.",3.9
2067,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"One of my favorite BA stouts.
Pours a dark black, with a nice tan head.Not much head retention as its common with some BA beers.
Aroma is amazing, complex and decadent mix of vanilla, chocolatey bourbon, caramelized sugar, cookie dough, with hints of coffee and oak.
Taste is just as good. Smooth bourbon laced chocolate,lots of vanilla, caramelized sugar, followed up by hints of coffee, roasted malts, and oak. Incredible.
Mouthfeel is silky smooth, with a mellow carbonation.
Over all one of my favorite BA stouts. Mikkeller makes some incredible stous, Huge fan of the shake series. The non barrel aged ones can be too sweet for people. But this BA version is damned near perfect, everything comes together so nicely.",4.6

2071,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense and rocky tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Great spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas and flavors of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with lighter notes of molasses, toffee, and yeast/oak earthiness.

Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a VERY silky, velvety, and slick mouthfeel that is fantastic. Minimal warming alcohol for 13.4%. Overall this is an amazing BBA imperial stout.

2093,West Ashley,"One of my favorites of all time of any style.
Roll the bottle around before opening to get a little bit of cloud from the yeast on the bottom, if that's your thing.
Smells like lemon, sour cherries, peachy.
Tastes just like the smell. Dry, smells sweeter than it tastes. Hint of funk.
West Ashley used to taste a lot more tart, but just tastes like sweet nectar now after having it so many times.",4.87
2094,West Ashley,"Orange citrus with peaches, this is so easy to drink its no wonder it is in a 750ml bottle. Sante focuses on this funk that their beers offer that I have not tasted in many other breweries that are also known for their ales and saisons, and this was no slacker. A very mellow orange taste is felt at the start but soon the strong peach taste in this one that will blow your mind, the tartness you would expect is minimal if any as the peaches are sweet enough to make your tastebuds focus on that.",4.56
2095,West Ashley,"Bottled 4/20. Poured into teku. Beautiful, glowing orange with some short lasting fizzy head. This was a mild gusher when I opened it, but the carbonation on the pour and the tongue is moderate. Smell is of sour and apricots. Taste is fantastic.

Reminiscent of something from cantillon, vinnie or tomme.",4.52

2099,West Ashley,"Pours a dense orange, quarter inch bubbly cap. Aroma is citrusy - I got my orange than apricot, though that is there as well. Palate has a great balance of tartness to the fruit notes - it isn’t super-lactic or puckering, but allows that orange & apricot to come through nicely with anchoring it with some tart funk. Finishes tart and crisp",4.69
2100,West Ashley,"This bottle came to me by way of a BIF - I don't know exactly which batch it is, but the fruit is still rich and deeply present. The apricot notes are super ripe and pulpy. It's very sour, almost cheek-puckering. The fruit is still predominant, though the sourness is very forward. The pour is a lovely, light gold-yellow. It's just slightly transparent, more than you might expect of a saison.",4.66

Smells strongly of booze, wood, toffee, raisin, brown sugar, barley, vanilla, coconut, and caramel, cognac gives a sweeter complexion. Taste is rich, cognac booze, wood, with rich toffee/caramel, molasses, and everything from the smell, especially dark fruits and a hint of candied cherry lingering. Much sweeter than the 2020.

2134,A Deal With The Devil,"Batch 2, pours brown into the glass, not overly thick, small lighter brown head on the top, 1/5"". Aroma and appearance both look and smell like cognac. Massive amount of fusel like alcohol waft from the glass. Wow, this is just like smelling rubbing alcohol.",2.93
2135,A Deal With The Devil,"Batch 2. Poured form bottle into snifter. Dark amber color. Nose is caramel, cognac and raisins. The taste follows he nose. The cognac blends so perfectly here. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth. Overall this is the best barelywine I have had the opportunity to enjoy.",4.99
2136,A Deal With The Devil,Brown appearance with no head. Aroma is a very nice barleywine with a touch of cognac. Taste is a very smooth barleywine with a nice touch of cognac.,4.67
2137,A Deal With The Devil,"This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was dark brown color with a slim one finger white to slight off white somewhat foamy head that dissipated within a light lacing. The smell was full of sweet darkened caramel boozy malt. The taste had a full boozy sweet caramel malty flavor. There is a slight boozy sweet caramel aftertaste that lead to sweet yet dry finish. On the palate, this sat about a medium to heavy on the body. I don’t mind the thickness on this beer - it’s a barleywine, it’s supposed to be this way. Boy, does this super smooth over my tongue. Overall, well, Gabe Fletcher, yeah dude, you knocked this one outa the park.",4.6
2138,A Deal With The Devil,"Pours a lively mahogany hue with thin, tight, off-white band around the edges. Nose expresses smokey notes, molasses and brown sugar. Taste follows nose - sweet and cloying, but not in a bad way in theses circumstances and the cognac barrel (wood and spirits) comes forth in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium in body with an almost still carbonation and an oily texture. Overall, nothing short of amazing. I just wish the price point wasn't so dear.",4.22
2139,A Deal With The Devil,Had 2014 version aged for 2 years 4 months. Very smooth and lots of taste. Had a smooth cognac barrel taste with no heat to it. Compares well to MOAS. Had a debate over which was better. Think I prefer Moas by a hair though I'd have to side by side to be sure.,4.45
2140,A Deal With The Devil,"I am not always a big fan of barleywines, but this one absolutely knocked my socks off. Everything about this big boy is, paradoxically, in your face, and yet, very nuanced. Lots of candied molasses, toffee, caramel, drambuie, cognac, orange and lemon zest, kiwi, strawberry, dates, vanilla, oak, and even a touch of the kind of tartness one might find in a world class lambic. I paid around fifty for this bottle of Batch #1, and I've seen them selling on the internet for at least twice that (and it would still been well worth the experience.",5
2141,Saint Lamvinus,"Bottle, RBESG 2005, Grand Tasting. Cloudy reddish colour with brownish tones. Intense barnyard and ""fruits of the forest"" aroma. Intensely sour flavour, lemons with notes of raspberries and blackcurrants. Overpowering and delightful at the same time.",4.11

2145,Saint Lamvinus,"January 1st, 2016 - I'm feasting on the 2010 addition of this bottle, and it is a European treat, with a barnyard smell that is appealing even if it is a little feral. It has a rich, fecund, manure scent with horse blanket and soil. At last, after seeing these descriptors attached to wine and cheese and other delicacies I can see why animal poop can be something nice on a beer's bouquet. And the beer surprises again with the first taste, and an incredibly well crafted sourness, with any excessiveness acid trimmed and leaving a brilliant profile. It hints and teases at sweetness, but falls just short, instead offering tartaric tang. Brilliance in a bottle, with a side of horse.",4.53
2146,Saint Lamvinus,"Received from @2beerdogs in NBS BIF #10. Reviewed 1/19/20. Thanks Derek!
Faintly stamped on rear label “2018”. A more legible dating is found on the cork which broke when being pulled. The end of the cork exposed to the lambic was stained opera mauve. Stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 54 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 57 degrees.
Appearance – 4.
First pour – Mauve, clear.
Body – Garnet, translucent. When held to direct light, cardinal red and clear.
Head – Gone by the end of the pour. A single tiny bubble-wide crown and no cap remain.
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 4 – Initially a very fruity grape odor which fades into a weak vinous fragrance.
Flavor – 4 – Begins slightly bitter with subdued grape flavor. Ends slightly dry with a bit of pink grapefruit aftertaste on the tongue. Not sure if the bitterness is from the grapes used, the lambic process, or some tannins from the barrels – it’s more of a background teeth-squeaking thing. No alcohol (7 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or flavor. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.
Palate – 4 – Medium, watery, soft but lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. I love the color. Where I live, concord grapes rule, and I’m not a wine drinker (except for an occasional bottle or three of tawny port), so beer based on Merlot grapes are somewhat of a novelty. Now, I think it’s time to start seeking more Saint Lamvinus. Thanks Derek – I needed a new quest!",4.1
2147,Saint Lamvinus,"Pours a clear, deep, dark ruby red coloration with a small, fizzy head that fades to a thin ring around the glass almost instantly, with very slightly visible carbonation. Smell is quite dominated by a lovely tart red grape aroma, with milder notes of blue cheese funk and musty oak, as well as just a hint of red berries and mild tannins. Taste is an excellent balance of quite vibrant, slightly tart red grapes, some light blue cheese funk and a distinct, mildly tannic, musty oak presence, as well as subtle hints of red berries, lemon peel and balsamic vinegar. Finishes quite dry, with a light tartness and some red grapes and musty oak lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, effervescent mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/strong carbonation.",4.52
2148,Saint Lamvinus,"De Tercertiempocervezas. Version 2018. En copa Teku. Viendo El Hombre en el Castillo 2x01-02. Con turron suchard y galletas tostarica. Una acidez mas comedida y soportable que en otras cantillon pero no dice mucho, apenas tiene interes. Las uvas no se notan casi nada",2.75

2152,Saint Lamvinus,"Cantillon Saint Lamvinus, 7% ABV. Pours a beautiful deep red, with a one finger pinkish head that dissipated while I got a good picture, leaving no lacing. Nose is light grape and wine. Taste is dry wine with some tartness, and not much bitterness or funk. Feel is decent, good carbonation and dry. Overall excellent. I know this is highly rated, but I'm not loving it.",4.1
2153,Saint Lamvinus,"Between wine and beer, this one is the least funky brew I've had from Cantillon. Pungeant notes of merlot are present. The lambic is present to balance the whole but never dominates the beverage.
Quite unique. Perfectly mastered.",4.96
2154,Saint Lamvinus,"Had this outside and it had a striking bright red color with a wispy pink head. Aroma was fresh cherries mixed with barnyard funk. The taste featured slightly tart cherries with red grapes, hay, leather, some bleu cheese, and funk. A nice long red-wine finish. Light-to-medium bodied and extremely easy to drink.",4.53
2155,Saint Lamvinus,"This is indeed a great Belgian Lambic. It might be the best Lambic I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't easy to get in the states.",4.71
2156,Saint Lamvinus,"Earthy, wonderfully tart and lightly sour, funky - beautiful pour, lightly effervescent and carbonated. The grapes are pungent and rich in the mouth.",4.68
2157,Saint Lamvinus,"09/2013 - always a consistently elegant, complex, and just damn delicious lambic; the grape pops everywhere, classic cheesy funk; dope as fuck from beginning through the finish, no matter the vintage.",4.71
2158,Saint Lamvinus,"Poured a non-translucent light purple color - almost like diluted grape juice. Very little head on presentation. The smell is tart, dry and vinous with a whiff of grape skins and oak. Some funk pushing through in the nose. The taste is so balanced and easy to drink. It's tart, dry (not as dry as many of their other fruit lambics), mildly sour with just a slight oak mustiness and notes of fresh grapes skins. While it is an overall dry lambic, there is some sweetness from the grapes that balances out the tartness. It has a medium bodied mouthfeel with just mild acidity, not too harsh. Overall, one of the better Cantillon's I've tried. It really stands out for being well balanced. While it used Merlot grapes, I wouldn't describe the beer having a taste resembling the qualities of Merlot (leathery and dark fruits), however this is a 2014 bottle and it may differ from a fresher version. It does have a nice vinous quality which I assume are from the Merlot grapes.",4.62
2159,Saint Lamvinus,Soft ripe exotic grape creamy with enough lactic but not too much not yogurt level. Next level blending skills or just right in my wheelhouse. Absolutely reccomend if given the chance to try. Possibly a touch above Fou?,4.59
2160,Saint Lamvinus,"One of the best Cantillon beers I’ve tried. 2016 bottle poured into a stemmed bulb. Pours hazy and pulpy plum purple color. Beautiful color. Aromas of earthy grape and funk. Taste is amazing. The grapes used in this are so unique and just taste so amazing. Earthiness, funk and some hints of red wine. Feel is thick for this style. Drinks with some body. Overall, this is an amazing Lambic and one of the best I’ve had.",4.77
2161,Saint Lamvinus,"Look: Clear Purple with medium pink fizzy head that recedes immediately. Has medium carbonation.
Smell: Merlot grapes, oak, tart, and cherries.
Taste: Tart, merlot grapes, oak, and a little funk.
Mouthfeel: Light and delicate.
Overall: A good lambic from Cantillon, but I don’t think this lives up to the hype or the price tag.",4.42
2162,Saint Lamvinus,"Look: thick 1.5 purple red head, color is a clear blood red
Smell: beautiful crisp funk, some oak, cherry and a very powerful merlot.
Taste: clean tart sour is the first impression, as it settles you get oak and a ton of grape
Feel: chewy like a big thick mouth feel and body, medium carbonation and finishes semi dry.",4.47
2163,Saint Lamvinus,"Pours a cloudy burgundy with a thin almost pinkish white ring of foam around the edge. The nose is not stellar in this beer. Strong barnyard, but not pleasant like other cantillon beers. A bit vinegary and only hints of the vine. The taste is altogether different from the nose. Very balanced with an ultra sweet middle, mild funk, and clean dry finish. Not really vinous in flavor, more grapeish. Feel is light and effervescent. Overall this beer scares you when you take a whiff but it unexpectedly lives up to the hype in the flavor which has no bearing to the smell. There is a little bit of wine in the nose but approaches more grape.",4.22
2164,Saint Lamvinus,"I have had several vintages of this and I must say I like it more young. The wine is not overbearing but provides a brightness that is just wonderful. Dark fruit on the nose and palate. Some funk, but not overbearing. It was more like blackberry or jam than wine but this was tasty.",4.63
2165,Saint Lamvinus,"5800th review! 750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/14/2016. Listed at 7% on the label. Cork was wet under the cap, and almost fell apart removing it. Pours lightly hazy ruby reddish orange/pink/purple color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light pink head with good retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, and cracker; with lighter notes of leathery/musty funk, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of complexity of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, and cracker; with lighter notes of leathery/musty funk, vanilla, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate fruity/lactic tartness; light fruit tang and yeast/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of tart plum, apricot, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, cranberry, red grape, fruit skin, lemon, lime, green apple, grapefruit, hay, straw, grass, cork, wood, wheat, cracker, light leather/funk/vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/tartness balance, and zero puckering flavors after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from tartness and tangy/tannic fruit/oak. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately bready/grainy, fairly crisp, and acidic/tangy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an excellent fruit lambic. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/fairly acidic yeast, red grapes, pale malt, and oak barrel flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the modestly lactic/tangy/tannic/drying finish. Well rounded Brett complexity and solid Lacto presence. Perfectly balanced between grapes, oak, and malts. Was expecting way more out of this. Not as much depth in funky complexity, and not as jammy/vinous on fruit character as I wanted. A very enjoyable offering, and spot on style example otherwise.",4
2166,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"Canned 10/05/20. Dark yellow, big head of fluffy white foam. Sweet smell of citrus and tropical fruits. Soft mouthfeel.

2168,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"Looks and smells gorgeous. Lots of citrus and tropical flavors on the nose.

2171,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,"Pours a mango-orange with a murky transparency and a finger of white foam that retains well. Aroma is earthy papaya, tangerine and grapefruit with a little stone and yeast beyond. It's tropical fruit opening lingers for a while, letting the base pale ale (which is already very hoppy) show throw in fragments. Aroma is akin to a very powerful NE IPA. Flavor profile is papaya, tangerine, mango, tangerine with a little earthy, nutty malt and raw grain and yeast to sooth things out. It's tropical fruit through and through, and drinks very similar - identical - to Trillium's Northeast IPA (this is labeled as an American Pale Ale at the time of review). All this to say, it's incredible hop forward, much more so than other pale ales, which may be a deterrent for some. Mouth feel is a little gritty, silty and soft, with a medium-thick consistency. It's liken to a well-worn lumpy, linen pillow. Overall, despite a slightly misleading style, the name of the beer lets those knowledgeable about beer that the hop content is going to be high, thus I will not knock it for the style mis-interpretation. It's big and flavorful, which is welcome in a beer. It combines well with the lightly gritty texture to develop a refined, but well-worn and knowledgeable, experience.",4.39

But whats not up for debate, is the notation that this is a world class brew! Because it is!

2194,Triple Shot,"Pours pitch black color with 2 finger foamy light brown colored head that faded very slowly and left excellent thick foamy lacing coating the glass after each sip. Smells of fresh brewed coffee, ground coffee beans, espresso, burnt coffee grinds, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, hot fudge, brown sugar, molasses, bakers chocolate, brownie batter and faint piney notes. It is rich smelling with so much chocolate and coffee that they battle for attention.",4.58
2195,Triple Shot,"We're finally at the last new beer from my latest Tree House run. As far as their stouts go I've mostly had only a few of their milk stouts, and only 1 imperial stout before this. Let's see if this one can hold a candle to the likes of Moment Of Clarity",4.22
2196,Triple Shot,"Really interesting what double the coffee of Tree House Double Shot will do. Sweetness comes to the fore in a big way.

looks like motor oil, deep dark black, no light seeing thru, looks dense/thick when pouring
smells chocolaty, sweet
tastes sweet, chocolate, coffee, I feel the sweetness is over-powered in this one, the more I drink the more sweetness I felt and all the other flavors were fading away or covered by the sweetness. malt is not noticeable.
medium-full body, stick to your mouth
overall a yummy and pleasant milk chocolate coffee stout except a little too sweet. also at 9.7% I wish it could be more complex but instead I felt it's maybe a little shallow.",4.53
2200,Triple Shot,"Another wonderful and worthy effort from Tree House, which is helping set standards for the style. This one has it all and is worthy of the high scores. Nose, balance, flavor character and biglasting finish. Very bold and drinkable.",4.5
2201,Triple Shot,Tons of coffee as expected. Get a little dark chocolate but the coffee really takes over. Great mouthfeel as most TH stouts have. The only negative is there was a sugary after taste that wasn't pleasant. I prefer double shot over this one.,4.44
2202,Triple Shot,Batch 1000! Smells like cold brew coffee and chocolate. Medium thick mouthfeel. Tastes exactly as it smells. Tons of coffee on the aftertaste. It’s fantastic.,4.45

2205,Triple Shot,"Yup. This is where it's at. I had this on draft at Tree House in March, 2020. I had tried Double Shot w/ Vanilla Bean before and absolutely loved it. This had what you'd expect from the name - just a bit more coffee flavor than Double Shot, but still without being overpowering or too bitter. One of the smoothest stouts I've ever had, and popping with flavor in even the smallest sip. Delicious creamy mouthfeel, and you didn't notice the 9% ABV until after the beer was gone. I actually bought a second draft, Alter Ego w/ Peach, and double-fisted them back and forth. They actually worked great together, like fruit and chocolate for dessert.",4.8

2213,Triple Shot,"Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass not sure when it was bottled. Pours midnight black on a cloudy day evening in the dead of winter, with a 2 finger mocha head that hangs out a bit, clinging to the sides of the glass like a fat kid the last pudding cup in the house, leaving big thick streaks of lace. 5",5
2214,Triple Shot,No bottling date but I picked this up at the brewery way back on 6/13/19. It says not to age but I wasn’t in a rush to drink it with so many other beers in the fridge having shorter lifespans.,4.59
2215,Triple Shot,"this stuff is divine, and in such an unassuming package too, crazy! thanks to my brother for sourcing this rarity, thought i might never get to taste this one. its a treat too, so much coffee, enough so even that is stands out as way more than the vanilla bean double shit, which we enjoyed right before this one. its almost gritty and bitter in comparison, but the vanilla sure did a lot to sweeten that up and round it out. here we have a truer expression of the coffee, more isolated in a way, and i love how robust it is, almost as much coffee as it is beer, although i do get a little booziness poking through this one in the aroma. the coffee has deep chocolate tones to it, a little spiciness even, a rigid sort of bitterness mid palate, and a real richness as well, notes of molasses and maple work in from the grain here, and there is a neat almost amaretto layer. maybe not quite as complex as the double shot was to me, a little more straight forward from the grain, but i love the way the coffee manifests itself in here, about as forward as i have known it to be in any beer, and lingering forever on the palate after each slow sip. this is the ultimate coffee beer really, and the freshness of the coffee really stands out as well, especially for something that was bottle many months before we opened it. it was wonderful to finally get to drink some of these hard to get tree house stouts, thanks to my brother! these were unforgettable!",4.5

2218,The Broken Truck,"It poured a hazy peach color with a foamy white head. The nose is earthy, musty and very floral with notes of lemon and melon.

2228,The Broken Truck,"for how hyped up this particular one is, it is nowhere near my favorite beer from de garde so far, and frankly nowhere near the objective best, if thats not nitpicking at this point (all of them being so fantastic). i love the story of this, but from the bottle, it didnt blow me away to the extent that some of their others have, especially some of the fruited ones. its really sour, more acidic than i remember most of them being, and that slows down drinkability a bit for sure, even with the amazing carbonation, soft round mouthfeel, and relative dryness to finish, its still just a slow sipper for me, which is probably how lambic should be anyway, but its sour enough to be harsh in the belly, and thats over the line for my preferences. perhaps this is a product of it being in the bottle too long, being a lambic type i was in no rush to open it, but not all of these age favorably apparently. the yeast profile under the acid is fantastic, musty bretty and funky, with distinct juicy fruitiness to it, white wine, apricots, even ripe pears, its rustic and interesting, but with the acid its pretty aggressive. the oak is sturdy here too, grounding and dense all the way through which i really like, it seems sort of oddly hoppy, like they definitely didnt use hops aged down to zero alpha acid, and if they did, there are some weird organic compounds in the mix here somehow. its got like a fruity linger in the finish i dont normally associate with the style. despite the developed brett and heavy wood, this doesnt seem as mature to me as i would have expected for something modeled on gueuze with the different vintages in the blend, less of the iodine medicinal character than the old world ones bring, and less of the hayloft agricultural harvest rustic character, this is almost too refined to fit that bill, not a criticism just a commentary. i think id like it more if the sourness were less, and dont get me wrong i still love it, but i would take a great many of their other beers before i took this one in a hypothetical draft of their best beers. always a treat to have their stuff though, and i can safely cross off this bucket list brew for now...",4.46

2239,The Broken Truck,"Light orange color with no head. Intense aroma. Tart with stone fruit, lemon, oak, green apple. Apple becomes more pronounced on the taste as it warms. Aggressive oak barrel, tannins, and lactic acid. Grapefruit, lemon. Mouth feel is medium to full. It's a little too acidic to be elite, but this is a fantastic beer.

2243,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a quarter finger high dark tan head that has excellent retention properties and hardly died down.
S: Light to moderate aromas of bourbon, coffee and cinnamon are present in the nose, the latter of which becomes stronger as the beer warms up.
T: The taste follows the smell and has additional notes of vanilla from the bourbon barrel aging. No alcohol is perceptible.
M: It feels medium- to full-bodied and smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. The cinnamon lends hints of heat in the finish.
O: This beer does a very good job at balancing all of the flavors together and is exceptionally easy to drink considering its strength.",4.4

Taste: molasses and caramel, chocolate, cinnamon, roasted notes of coffee and malt, vanilla, hints of wood, leather, tobacco, bourbon. Aftertaste of Christmas cake with chocolate and coffee sprinkled with cinnamon.
Feeling: cinnamon pleasantly pinches a round and velvety drink constantly embraced by a gentle ethyl heat of bourbon. A disarming balance between sweetness and bitterness. An elegant aging in barrels.

This is a world-class effort!",4.43
2249,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,A - Pours a very dark brown with a one finger creamy tan head. Nice amount of soapy lacing.,4.47
2250,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,Much darker than your average barleywine. Dark brown almost black color that seems to split the difference between barleywine and stout. Nose and taste are pure cinnamon. Coffee takes a back seat but is still there. Barrel really shines as well. Great beer.,4.79
2251,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,Vintage 2016. Consumed on 11/25/2020. Coffee is nonexistent and I'll guess it has faded over time. Chocolate stout notes are accented by cinnamon which is still strong. Maybe too much so. The barrel presence combined with the cinnamon spice make this a bit of a disappointment for my taste.,4.02

2255,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"Pours black with a finger and a half of caramel-mocca colored foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is coffee and cinnamon right on the nose. Coffee is roasty with the cinnamon adding a little spicy dryness. Toffee, caramel and chocolate add sweetness with roasty, toasty and nutty malts adding adding base and depth. Flavor profile is all the same - rich chocolate laced with a blend of roasty coffee and dry cinnamon. Toffee, molasses and chocolate add further sweetness, but only just a little squeeze. Roasty, toasty and nutty malts add the base. Wow. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety texture is chewy. Overall, dense and loaded with coffee & cinnamon for a delightful and special treat.

2259,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"2019 edition. Dark, boozy, with wonderful smells and tastes of bourbon, cinnamon, and chocolate - more than coffee. Very warming as it goes down. Easy to see why this is one of the best.",4.87
2260,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"Got this in a trade with Jay Whitson. Thanks Jay!! 2018 edition, waxed and capped.",4.6
2261,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"Dark brown pour with good tan head.
Immediately hit with the bourbon barrel upon pouring. Roasty, coffee, cinnamon notes as well.
Taste is cinnamon, coffee, vanilla, roasty malts, bourbon.
Medium to full body with good carb levels.
Overall an excellent coffee/cinnamon BA stout. Nicely balanced.",4.66
2262,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"Bottle: Poured a very dark brown color ale with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of caramelized malt with some chocolate, cinnamon and bourbon notes is quite enticing. Taste is a rich and complex mix of bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon with some floral coffee and light woody notes with some residual sugar notes also perceptible. Body is full with good carbonation and light warming notes. Exceptional beer.",4.5
2263,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"L: Poured from a wax sealed bomber, this beer is visually appealing with a very dark pour and a light tan, thick head.
S: A very strong bourbon scent hits you if you get within 15ft of this beast. A close sniff gets you a tiny bit of cocao.
T: This is where this beer goes from great to world renowned. It is perfectly balanced with just enough cinnamon to be noticable without killing it's other flavors. While it smells strongly of bourbon, its flavor is not overwhelmed by liquor.
F: In truth it has a mouth feel more in line with a stout than a winter ale but that's likely because not many winter ales are bourbon barrel aged so there's not much to compare to. It is very smooth on the tongue and no burn from it's 13% abv.
O: This is a truly amazing beer that I'm glad I had the pleasure of trying. It smells enticing, looks great, and tastes like heaven. If heaven knows how to properly bourbon barrel aged that is.",4.59
2264,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"Dark brown with a garnet hue. Thin head quickly settles into a tan crown with zero lacing. Strong coffee in the nose with some clear cinnamon behind. The taste is all about the cinnamon though. It’s not at insane levels, but it’s definitely the first and last thing you taste, with some coffee, roasted malts, licorice and bourbon flavors playing a supporting role. Relatively full bodied and creamy, while maintaining a definite slickness. Fun to try, and the coffee addition is very nice, but I prefer the regular B-Bomb.",4.18
2265,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"Not sure why people are down on Fremont, every single beer I have had from them has been incredible, this one is no exception. Extremely dark brown with a tan collar. Cinnamon and coffee (shocker) lead the aromas of bourbon, oak, cocoa, vanilla, coconut, brown sugar and dark fruit, kind of get a boozy gourmet french toast complexion, amazing. Taste is a touch heavier, with the cinnamon coming in powerfully right away. Leather and other holiday spices are thrown in with everything from the taste, melds together so amazing while have contrasting flavors to build on. Feel is chewy, full, smooth, with good spice, barrel, and coffee textures. Amazing, but for a strong ale it is almost too well put together, give it a touch more bite but I am nitpicking. The wife liked it",4.71
2266,Abricot Du Fermier,Batch 5 - 750ml bottle - Poured into a white wine stem at 40°F and allowed to warm up.,4.52
2267,Abricot Du Fermier,"A: An upbeat melon, carrot orange pour with mild yellow inserts. The collar is practical and comes slightly off-white with adequate retention",4.02
2268,Abricot Du Fermier,"Gold In color and hazy in complexion. There’s a fingernail of off white around the rim. The aroma is an assault of apricots and a touch of brettanomyces. I’m tasting tart brettanomyces and apricots. The mouth is very dry, highly carbonated, and crisp.",4.25
2269,Abricot Du Fermier,7 May 2020 - Beer #88 - BA Top 250 Alert!,5
2270,Abricot Du Fermier,"Hazy orange body with tons of funk on the nose. Some tartness, but not too much. Delicious funky flavor that you only get biting into an apricot, just perfect.",4.93
2271,Abricot Du Fermier,"The beer pours a hazy straw yellow with a moderate white head, it has medium carbonation. It smells of apricots, nectarines, and red wine. The beer is tart, with big apricot, juicy nectarines, red wine, and oak. The beer is multi layered, and very juicy. An excellent saison from Side Project.",4.79
2272,Abricot Du Fermier,"This is the best sour saison I have ever had. Not even up for debate. The apricot is the perfect star for all of the delicately balanced flavors in the original. Has a bit of wine dryness to go with the sour and smooth tartness that really made the mouthfeel just mind-bendingly good. Rich, complex, smooth and acidic.",4.75
2273,Abricot Du Fermier,"Another superb SP fruited sour - eff yes! Awesome apricot, peach abound; yet not acidic whatsoever; nice tartness in the back of the palate; creamy, slightly sweet, and just crushable AF.",4.46
2274,Abricot Du Fermier,Poured from a 750mL bottle into a SP stemmed wine glass.,4.59
2275,Abricot Du Fermier,"Pours a beautiful golden - surprising clarity, I'd expected more yeast suspension. Immediately after popping the cap, apricot permeated the air - it has a tremendous nose, clean and tart and fruity. The taste follows suit - tart, sour, full of apricots. Rich, yet not the yeasty beast that I had anticipated. Finish is fairly clean as well, which is surprised me a bit. This is quite likely one of my top 3 beers from Side Project at this point - I'd gladly trade for more any day!",4.75
2276,Abricot Du Fermier,750 ml poured into a teku at a share.,4.52
2277,Abricot Du Fermier,Blend #3.,4.15
2278,Abricot Du Fermier,"this is really good, no doubt about it, but not as good as they say it is i dont reckon, and once again a side project beer doesnt quite live up to its hype. their culture has trended super sour lately, and this is another expression of that, just really acidic beer, complex still, still lots of nuance, bretty funk and oak and all, but its the bacterial intensity that takes over this one and makes it a hard large bottle to drink, even split a couple of ways. i really like to let these types of beers warm up a little bit, but not here, its best when its colder, with temperature comes acidic intensity thats hard on the teeth and belly. i like all the apricot of course, about as natural as it gets, super ripe and even soft and fuzzy like the real fruit, very forward and incredibly natural and delicious, the authenticity is through the roof. i kind of wanted to taste more of the wine in the barrel profile, which is tannic and heavily oaky, but not as red wine forward as i might have thought for cabernet. all the wood is nice, subtle vanilla and even white tea somehow, killer with the apricots, peach juice notes, even green apple and white grape wrapped up in here, lots going on, but instead of mellowing into a slow tart bretty funkiness like i wish it did, the sourness cranks and disrupts the delicate beauty, it finishes harsh and big. i mean, in all respects this is great beer, but it just doesnt stand with the best wild beers in the world to my palate, maybe those who prefer a more assertive acidity will disagree, but i think its a little too much, unflattering to the fruit, and at $45 a bottle it just doesnt do it for me...",4.39
2279,Abricot Du Fermier,"Pours a beautiful straw - light orange color. Pitch white frothy head which dissipates fairly quickly leaving a sudsy ring around the glass. Nose is ripe apricot, stone fruit, prickly pear, getting some oak, barnyard funk, bready yeast. Taste. Taste is follows the nose, getting apricots, green apple, lemon, a little grassy note. Tart, but not puckering. Acidic, but not harsh. Great smooth pillowy mouthfeel. Soft on the palate. Overall a fantastic fruited Saison. Everything you would want, very well balanced.",4.59
2280,Abricot Du Fermier,"Abricot Du Fermier, Batch #3, is beautiful. It's what you hope for based on its name. Glowing bright yellow, smooth and even soft looking. A fluffy white cloud is perched above the bright sunshine from below, and it's making me thirsty.",4.53
2281,Abricot Du Fermier,Nice sour qualities but on par with a lot of apricot sours. I dig the white wine barrel qualities. Quite full feel for a wild ale. Nice overall but nothing mind blowing particularly for the hype surrounding this one. As this warms the sour qualities become quite abrasive. Glad I split this between 4.,4.21
2282,Abricot Du Fermier,"Super vibrant orange, almost neon, with a persistent lumpy off-white foam that settles to a thick collar and thin film.",4.02
2283,Abricot Du Fermier,Had this on tap last weekend at the cellar- look and feel were both light and great for the style. Smell was good but not overwhelming. The taste was off the charts incredible. The best sour I've ever had.,4.84
2284,Abricot Du Fermier,"poured from a 750mL bottle into an oversized snifter. pours a hazy and bubbly orange with fluffy bright white head, which eventually dissipates leaving a nice foam collar around the glass. some off-white swirls remain throughout the pour. smells of fresh sliced apricot, oak, wine and a hint of vanilla. it’s all there and combines for an amazing aroma but the fruit is the star here. the barrels give it more complexity than it would have otherwise but it’s very fruit forward. taste is basically dominated by fruit, however, the barrel characteristics are more noticeable than on the nose. it’s sour but it’s also refreshing. borders on light and heavy as it starts off lighter, simple and more refreshing but gets heavier and more complex as it lingers on the tongue and finishes. feel is smooth and full with an oaky dryness on the finish. overall, this is my favorite fruited fermier as i feel like apricot works so well with sour beer. the combination of the base beer along with red wine barrels and apricots is exquisite. this one probably doesn’t show the balance that some of the other fruited fermiers have (Pêche and Kriek come to mind) but i don’t mind that at all as this allows the apricots to shine with just enough backup from the extended-aged base SdF.",4.71
2285,Abricot Du Fermier,"Batch 2, poured into a taster. Funky apricots and oak, soft mouthfeel, nice tartness without being super acidic. One of my favorite Side Project offerings to date!",4.69
2286,Abricot Du Fermier,Pours a orangish opaque color with a small white head. Smells of funky sour apricots. Taste is very acidic and tart with a pungent sour finish. A realmouth puckered. But in a great way. Wonderful thick mouthfeel.,4.85
2287,Abricot Du Fermier,"B2, Had this side by side with 30 other tremendous apricot sours and saisons. It was a damn good beer but i liked La Fosse better and Westly. Maybe it was more apricotty fresh but it was tart and good, but didn't blow me out of the water either.",4.26
2288,Abricot Du Fermier,batch 2 drank on 5/13/2017 at dld,4.75
2289,Abricot Du Fermier,"Combined notes for Batch 1 and Batch 2. Really nice apricot notes and a bit creamy. Batch 2 was a bit too acidic for my taste, though I'm fairly sensitive to that. As with Fou Foune, would prefer to drink this one as fresh as possible to avoid too much acid buildup.",4.5
2290,Abricot Du Fermier,Bottle: Poured alight peachy color ale with a bubbly head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of light apricot and tart notes is pretty refreshing and pleasant. Taste is a nice mix of tart notes with some fresh apricot notes and a white wine-like finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. Acidity level is kept at a reasonable level. Very refreshing with solid mix of complexity.,4.22
2291,Breakfast Stout,"Canned on date 12/22/20 and enjoyed in a 16oz Founders snifter on 10/15/21.
Appearance: Pours a dark brown almost black with a finger of khaki medium brown colored foam. Great head retention and nice lacing as the foam dissipates
Smell: Deep complex roasted coffee malts with associated bitterness. The bitterness is balanced out with lovely notes of chocolate and earthiness and a bit of oat flavor. Subtle bourbon flavors of vanilla and oak as well. I will admit that it’s frustrating to get these complex coffee chocolate aromas and not be able to describe but I’ll leave it at that.",4.55
2292,Breakfast Stout,Look: Black in color with a thin head that quickly dissipates. Relatively minimal lacing on the glass.,4.24
2293,Breakfast Stout,"I bought this one on a whim. I love stoats, especially spiced, coffee, and chocolate one, so i figured I’d give this one a try. I was so pleasantly surprised. This is truly one of the best beers I’ve ever had. And, it has a decent alcohol content as well. I like it when a single beer is enough to relax me. This one tastes like dessert. DEFINITELY TRY IT!",5
2294,Breakfast Stout,"Look: Dark liquid, like black coffee. Camel leather colored head that was short in height and slowly melted to a thin ring around the glass with moderate lacing.
Smell and Taste: Coffee and chocolate from the get go.
Feel: Slightly oily. Perfect amount of carbonation.
Overall: Excellent, well balanced stout.",4.49
2295,Breakfast Stout,Founders Breakfast Stout is an amazing beer that luckily can be found widely.,4.53
2296,Breakfast Stout,"12oz bottle fill date of 3/11/21 into a large snifter.
L: Pours very deep dark brown with a light ruby cast at it's outer edges. It has a dark tan thin head that dissipates to edge foam. No visible carbonation. Some minimal spotty lacing.
S: Coffee, raisins, dark caramel, bourbon, chocolate, toffee.
T: Coffee, sweet chocolate, oak cask, raisins, oats, bitter chocolate, cinnamon, earthy char, burned coffee, charred bread crust.
F: It has a rich, lightly syrupy heavy mouthfeel with ample bitterness and a medium length finish. It does not go wide nor is it too dynamic. For the most part the mouthfeel is centralized.
O: A bittersweet oatmeal stout with profoundly deep columns of flavors. Poured, over time the beer has subtle changes in it's taste which help lead to it's overall deliciousness. A lovely portion of hops go elegantly with the char, coffee and sweet caramel. An incredible example in it's style.",4.59
2297,Breakfast Stout,"12 oz. Bottle poured into ale glass
Look: Two finger tan head, dark color like a cola, lots of carbonation. Lace stays. After half a glass, still retains a thin layer of foam...like an espresso.
Smell: Smell hit before the pour. Chocolate and coffee, like a chocolate covered coffee bean.
Taste: Hits with coffee first then dark chocolate follows. Bitterness as expected but not too bitter.
Feel: Coats the tongue, bubbles give nice tickle.
Overall: Not usually a stout fan but with the chocolate and coffee it is good. Don't drink with food, enjoy alone with sips not gulps.",4.28
2298,Breakfast Stout,"Pours a dark, non-see-through, coffee/espresso with a moderate head that dissapates quickly but lingers on the glass.",4.66
2299,Breakfast Stout,Bottled 3/11/21. This is the perfect time for a summer spring winter beer.,3.89
2300,Breakfast Stout,From a bottle to a glass,4.47
2301,Breakfast Stout,"finally time for me to chip in my opinion on this website’s most reviewed beer. I actually got this beer unintentionally, i had bought a bottle of founder’s porter from mchugh’s in kilbarrack, but they were out of stock and sent me this instead, quite the upgrade indeed. this beer is very tasty, pours black as night, tan coloured head with quite good retention, big nose, lot of coffee and chocolate, this beer is super coffee forward, ground coffee beans, espresso, earthy, roasty toasty flavour, burned bread, milk and dark chocolate, nice balance between sweet and bitter flavours, body is creamy and light for a strong stout like this, but still medium to full bodied, some alcohol warming, a very nice stout from a very good brewery.",4.3
2302,Breakfast Stout,"Pours jet black with a thick light brown head.
Smells immediately of rich coffee with lots of chocolate and a little tobacco.
Bold chocolate flavor with plenty of roasted malt. Slightly bitter finish and the coffee comes strong in the aftertaste.
This is a smooth well balanced delicious beer. Where is the 8.3% hiding. This is not my first and definitely not my last time drinking this world class stout.",4.77
2303,Breakfast Stout,A decent stout that I forgot to log when I drank it. I could get the coffee and chocolate but it still lacked the thickness that I was looking for. At 8.2 ABV it still lacked the punch that I was looking for.,3.28
2304,Breakfast Stout,"Definitely has a raisin type smell. The flavor follows suit but you can distinguish the chocolate initially and the coffee on the backend. I like this beer but it’s not as complex as some of the other Founders which some may appreciate but I for one enjoy the mirage of flavors. Not a bad beer, just simple. Maybe if I had tried this before I tried so many of the other breakfast stout variants, I would have a different opinion.",3.84
2305,Breakfast Stout,"Previously consumed and often, this review will be perfunctory. It's undeniably one of the best in the world. Out from the 12 ounce bottle into a clear Imperial pint glass, it's a richly deep and dark brown with a modest tan head. The roasted malt, chocolate and oat aroma can't be surpassed by any in this style. It just might be the smoothest and richest brew you can find. The taste overall is complexly bittersweet. There's so much good going on, but the prominent flavors are roasted, not burnt nor overly roasted barley malt, then coffee, then chocolate. If that's not enough for the taste buds to discern, there's some sort of mild spiciness created by the infusion of the major contributors. An amazing mouthfeel for such an ABV, this may be the world's best stout.",4.78
2306,Breakfast Stout,"Bottled 1'21, consumed 4'21. Poured into a tulip glass (cuz i like those). Intentionally foamed it a bit & beer responded w/ small/mid-sized head.
Taste: Coffee, no chocolate, no coffee, ... well choco-coffee it is, but medium to full, not at all like a sweet mocha-java. Just the echo of sweetness. Hops are perfect - you couldn't enjoy this with too little and you couldn't experience the choco-coffee with too much. Perfect balance. Zero booziness for a heavy ABV beer.
Look: cross between motor oil & espresso, but not as thick as the stuff left in the coffee pot for 3-4 hours.
Overall: Has to be one of my faves for cool weather beers. Can stand up to a cigar but also good alone. Must be awesome out of the tap; maybe worth a trip to Grand Rapids.",4.59
2307,Breakfast Stout,"Great oatmeal stout full of rich flavors. Strong on the nose, but overall a solid beer. I am surprised this is ranked as #1 as far as oatmeal stouts are concerned, but still a great beer!",3.94
2308,Breakfast Stout,"Pours dark and opaque, with a dark tan head with moderate retention and nice lacing. Aroma is heavy with roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Taste follows, with coffee being the dominant flavor, with just a hint of cocoa. A strong body from the oats and roasted malt make for a delightful experience, with just a hint of alcohol warmth rounding out the silky smooth mouthfeel.",4.96
2309,Breakfast Stout,"This is hands down one of my favorite stouts. This and Old Rasputin would have to duke it out for top honors. There are few high production stouts that are this good, sorry Guinness.",5
2310,Breakfast Stout,"Ah yes, breakfast with the baby....this is the first stout I really appreciated. Once I started letting it warm a bit from fridge temp it really blossomed. It's also a best buy at $9.99 a 4-pack.",4.93
2311,Breakfast Stout,"This stout blew my mind at my first sip sometime ago. For whatever reason I am preferring stouts, porters, red ales and bocks over IPAs which were my preferred brew for a long time.
The flavors of Breakfast Stout rolled over the palate with many delicious surprises. It was (a while ago) my first experience with a coffee stout. Lots of body too. I wrote to Founder's claiming and surprisingly they answered me!
Top shelf.",4.73
2312,Breakfast Stout,"Black in color with a head that lingers with light brown.
Spicy aroma with a bit of malt and coffee as it warms.
This brew is full-bodied and creamy. A wonderful stout!",4.26
2313,Breakfast Stout,"Classic Oatmeal Stout, the appearance is ideal, lacing is prominent and lasting, aroma is ideal for the genre and the flavor, so full of coffee and oatmeal and malts and cocoa- just really tasty.
The feel is near perfect for an oatmeal stout and as far as over all, this is one that will definitely always be in my cellar.",4.79
2314,Breakfast Stout,"L- A rich midnight black color with a hazelnut head
S- Strong notes of barley and oatmeal, hints of coffee make this part of a complete breakfast. Reminds me of a diner
T- Many layers. A sweet black coffee taste in the beginning with a strong oatmeal and chocolate taste as the drink continues
M- Not as thick as one would think but average for a thiccer stout
O- Founders never ceases to impress, incredible in every way. What started by love of dark beer.",4.98
2315,Breakfast Stout,What can I say for a beer I've been a fan of for ages. I can buy a four of FBS for less than 9 bucks. I used to seek out this beer when it was hard to find and paid $15 a 4 pack back then. If you're a fan you know what the beer taste like. Say no more. This beer speaks for itself in its own category. It's always delicious.,4.69
2316,Trappistes Rochefort 10,Purchased as a single bottle from The Cellar (Troy) for $5.79. Poured into a pimp chalice.,4.98
2317,Trappistes Rochefort 10,Look: Chocolate brown. One finger of thin khaki head that quickly dissipates.,4.68
2318,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Pours a murky, dark brown color with ruby highlights. Unbelievably tall, billowing white foam head. Aroma is dark fruit and yeast. Nicely balanced taste of dark fruits, malt, fermented yeast, a bit of spice. Overall very good.",4.27
2319,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Hazy dark reddish mahogany with a massive tan head that persists and produces lots of nice lacing.
The aroma is sweet caramel malt, plums, raisins, maybe a touch of citrus.
The taste is along the same lines bur much more complex with dark caramel malt, Belgian candy sugar, figs, plums, bananas, citrus and just a touch of alcohol, finishes slightly dry and lingering coffee taste.
It is full bodied but very smooth, good sipping.
Altogether a very enjoyable brew, a great example of Belgian Abbey brewing.",4.94
2320,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Pours mahogany with a 2 inch tan head, which lasts. Heavy lacing to the end. Hazy.",4.66
2321,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"One of the best for a reason. Pours caramel color with a head that disappears quickly. Strong, smooth, and boozy. Chocolate and coffee aromas. Alcohol hits during the finish.",4.99
2322,Trappistes Rochefort 10,Some folks prefer St. Bernardus Abt 12 and it's hard to argue with that. But for my money the best quad is Trappistes Rochefort 10. It never fails to impress or satisfy. Definitely a desert island beer,4.88
2323,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"330 ML bottle, born on 3/4/2020, poured into a taster at 48 degrees F (tasting of the Trappistes Rochefort 6/8/10 with my sister and brother-in-law):
L - dark caramel, lighter than most quad's, lot's of head on the pour but dissipated quickly
S - caramel, fig, malt
T - nice flavors of caramel and toffee, not as full bodied as many quad's I've had
F - medium mouthfeel and carbonation
O - good, but I've had better quad's with more flavor from American craft brewers",4.25
2324,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Cerveza de color marrón, con una espuma esponjosa de buena retención. Cuerpo medio y carbonatación alta. Aroma a malta, caramelo y vainilla. Sabor dulce con notas de ciruela.
Sabrosa e imperceptible que estemos bebiendo una cerveza de 11.3% de alcohol. Una gran cerveza.",4
2325,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"look: brown/amber color, very muddy",4.59
2326,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Found this dusty on a shelf in my local deli, who knows how long it was there. Probably a really long time from the way it looked and the way the handwritten price was scrawled on a little round sticky on the top of this single. $5.49 it said. Must be a good price for a beer that has a 100/100 rating here. I'm very excited to try it as it's my first Trappist ale. Poured out into a clean snifter, light golden as it poured and darkening as it collected in the bottom of the glass. Nice inch of flaxen head that sticks around in a fluffy layer floating on top. Scent reminds me of banana and raisins predominantly and maybe some orange and grapefruit too. As i swirl the glass, the head foams up again robustly. Upon the first sip, I'm not as terribly impressed as i expected to be. Strong malt backbone, candies of butterscotch and sugary burnt bananas predominate. Also raisins, dates, figs. But it's also somewhat bitter with an earthy, musty type taste to it. Somewhat leathery. The 11% is well hidden and doesn't come through too strongly. Comes with a dry finish. Mouthfeel is full, well rounded, and highly carbonated. Overall it's a pretty good brew, but won't receive my highest marks. It's perhaps that I'm not trying several beers of this style in a row to pick the best. Perhaps my palate is still young and inexperienced. But regardless of what others say, I have to decide for myself. i tend to like big, heavy, thick, dense beers, with robust abvs, and maybe i was expecting the taste of a stout or porter. My only reference for this beer is really Golden Monkey, which I could just as easily pour if I wanted a beer of this style. Glad i tried it as it was quite the experience given the anticipation i had for this beer. However, i'm off to sample something a little heavier.",4.32
2327,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Picked up the 6, 8 and 10 all at once, a helluva deal in any circumstances.",4.5
2328,Trappistes Rochefort 10,Poured from a 330 mL bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip,4.44
2329,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"On the taste, first noticed spice, with a bit of booze, bready yeast with a hint of fruitcake/fig and some coffee. High carbonation and light mouthfeel. Very nice.",4.33
2330,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Look: dark amber, big cream head",4.72
2331,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Teku glass. Murky brown color with vibrant fluffy white head. Continued effervescence after the pour. Scents of red wine, raisins, and yeast on the nose. Flavors of raisins, plums, baking spice, and brown sugar. Hides the ABV really well. Belgian quads are my go-to on Christmas and glad I had one of these to enjoy this year- a classic and always delicious!",4.73
2332,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Appearance: Looks like Mars when held next to a light.
Smell: Spicy and sweet. Fresh baked bread, peppery alcohol, caramel, prunes, white grape and hay.
Taste: Big, sweet and complex. Demerara, grape juice, white pepper, wheat, banana and oak.
Feel: Chewy, well carbonated and on the drier side.
Overall: All systems nominal. Thank you, brothers.",4.26
2333,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Look: Very deep mahogany and very cloudy. Nice deep and creamy head.
Smell: Definitely a fair booze scent, but there's certainly some dark bread notes with a little bit of baking spice.
Taste: Follows nose with some raisin/date sweetness. Very similar to ABT 12, but even less bitterness and slightly more alcohol presence.
Feel: Creamy and medium-bodied. Lightly carbonated and it dissipates quickly.
Overall: Surprisingly crisp and makes for a great cold night beer. The alcohol provides a nice cozy warmness and the dark bread and spice characteristics make for a great dinner/desert drink.",4.53
2334,Trappistes Rochefort 10,Absolutely one of the very best beers I've ever had of any style.,4.85
2335,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Excellent beer. It doesn’t seem to have the flavor characteristics of other quads I have tasted. The spice is there, and sharp finish, bit the subtle esters I’ve tasted in other beers of the style seem to be not pronounced.",4.3
2336,Trappistes Rochefort 10,Opened a 2 1/4 year bottle that had been in my refrigerator for just about as long.,4.63
2337,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"As is the trend with all the Rocheforts, this has a muddle turbid appearance, with a slightly darker prune juice hue of brick red to brown, under a moderate, less active tan head that's softly convex, settling to a densely blanket that retains well.",4.19
2338,Trappistes Rochefort 10,"This is a wonderful Quad, but the alcohol notes are a bit hot for me. I typically prefer sub 10% beers and have enjoyed 'worse' quads more because there are a bit cooler. Highly recommend for an experience, but not a favorite.",4.15
2339,Trappistes Rochefort 10,Delicious Trappist Ale. Price can't be beat compared to Westvelten. This is a go to beer for Fall / Winter. Cant believe how close this is to the WestV. The lack of a creamy finiah is the real difference,4.6

2341,Saison Du Fermier,Thank you not2quick for this one!,4.26
2342,Saison Du Fermier,"Copper colored with a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering half of the top. The aroma is of green apple and pear and earthy saison yeast. I’m tasting green apple and pear. The mouth is moderately carbonated, dry, and crisp.",4.26
2343,Saison Du Fermier,"Perfect. Smells fruity, slightly floral as if a lovely Chardonnay fell into a bottle of Saison.
Light, airy carbonation, fruity up front and pleasingly sour on back. Mouthfeel like a cloud. Carbonation suitable for a Saison. So glad finally tried!",4.99

2347,Saison Du Fermier,"Just another example of Side Project leading the way in American wild ale production. This is b2, and it’s lightly carbed with rich hay, grain, funk and citrus flavors. All blended meticulously with some kick from the wine barrel at the finish. Outstanding.",4.75

2349,Saison Du Fermier,Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy golden color capped by a one finger head of foam; scattered lacing,4.45
2350,Saison Du Fermier,"Poured into a goblet. A bright yellow golden hazy beer with a medium white head. Aromas of hay, straw, lemons, and oranges. A hint of funk as well. Tart on the palate and mouth watering. More delicious with each sip. Great lemon and orange citrus mixed with hay, earthy notes, and a gentle funk. Dry and clean Easy drinking. Outstanding.",4.54
2351,Saison Du Fermier,"Simplistic beauty is how I would describe this beer. The sour, funk, grain and sweet notes all are perfectly balanced with one another. Smell is oak sour with slight yeast funk, with accents of orange, lemon, vanilla, faint white wine, and caramel apple. Taste is taking all of the elements of the smell and putting them through an oaken filter, causing a delicate blend of flavor. Wish there was a little more potency there. Acidic sourness defines the finish.",4.35
2352,Saison Du Fermier,"03/2015 - Another effing tasty beer from Side Project; lemon, funk, some barnyard, yeast aromas; effervescent, champagne, sweet, tart flavors on the palate; clean, crushable finish.",4.32
2353,Saison Du Fermier,"The best beer of 2018 so far. Bottle from Mikkeller NYC. Nose is pure farmhouse w/ some acidity, apple, pear, and wet leather. The taste is perfect. There is subtle tart w/ funk and earth from the yeast and grains. The blend is perfect. The feel is amazing, a little heavier then the typical tart saison but goes w/ this offering perfectly. Well worth actively seeking out if you are a fan of saison or sour beer.",4.84

2355,Saison Du Fermier,"b1. Slight gusher, but it just flooded the immediate area with floral and citrus aromas. A closer whiff reveals the typical SP rustic characteristics, though this seems to be much fruitier than some of their other offerings (at least the few I've had). It's almost like sticking your head inside of a used wine barrel.
Not sour but tarter in taste than the nose lends one to believe, but fits well with the fruitiness; reminiscent of a Gewürztraminer.",4.44

2361,Saison Du Fermier,"Pours a clear golden color with a white head. The aroma is relatively subdued. Little bit of funkiness and typical Saison aroma. The flavor is where this beer really shines. Absolutely exquisite says on with the perfect amount of tartness to balance it out and add that punch to each sip. Chardonnay notes come through very nicely.

The beer is 56 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer produced two-finger head. The head retention was short-lived but satisfying. The murky brown substance falls around SRM 22.

2403,Black Gold,"Had on tap. Void of nothingness black with a brown head. Sweeter nose than I was expecting: maple, chocolate, vanilla with contrasting powerful oak, robust malts, coffee grounds, char, and lingering licorice and earth. Taste leans much more on the robust elements, but has great melding of the flavors from the smell in a foreboding way. Massive and complex. Body is full and chewy, but not overly heavy, great wood textures and smoky earthiness within the booze. Well worth the search, an amazing stout that does not need adjuncts to thrill",4.69

Oak, tannins, plum, bitter dark chocolate, bourbon booze, and pepper round out the nose. The front palate is very restrained but quickly blossoms, with warming bourbon spice, barrel wood, vanilla, and fudge. Intense barrel character that I love--strong, with a lot of whiskey character, but without a hot mid-palate. Modestly dry finish that leans back into the vinous notes and adds just a touch of smoke.",4.47

But this beer wasn’t brewed with Starbucks; this is quality hipster coffee just like the dork that lives below you who rides a fixie to work. That being said, the only thing that Raul isn’t feeling is the sweet maple syrup (cause your boi ain’t into sweetness). Also, I wish the mouthfeel in the end was a lil more viscous. It’s not bad. It’s not Martha Hunt super model skinny, but I’d prefer if it was Ashley Graham large.",4.29

2427,Sunday Brunch,"What truly surprises me about Sunday Brunch is, in spite of being a non barrel-aged beer, just how complex and layered it is. The coffee is smooth and lightly roasty. The maple isn't super forward but it adds body and subtle, excellent flavor - tasting quite natural, by the way. The beer has great body and drinks easily. I really like this one - I can't imagine drinking a whole bottle by myself, but definitely enjoyed sharing this one with friends.",4.5

2434,Sunday Brunch,"While placing the imperial porter at the end of any session makes a lot of sense when it comes to impact on the palate, as it's usually the strongest flavored beer of the day, coffee stouts can get in touch with out inner insomniac. But the imperial coffee porter of Kane Brewing is strong in its effects while carrying a caffeinated jolt; perfectly suited for pick-me-up and put-me-down of brunch.",4.52

Smell is heavily roasted coffee bean, sort of slightly burnt in a way, milk chocolate, cinnamon, a bit of green pepper and espresso. A bit weird at first, I think the coffee and cinnamon combined to make it smell a bit burnt. Flavour is much better though, not a ton of maple syrup but neither is it too sweet. Cinnamon lingers the background throughout, perhaps contributing a slight green pepper, black coffee and dark fruit, a fair bit of milk chocolate and caramel. Mouthfeel is full bodied, thick and substantial, good carbonation and a smooth chocolate-forward finish. It kind of tastes like cinnamon sprinkled on chocolate frosting, in a good way.",4.35
2440,Sunday Brunch,"Pours a rich chocolate black color that is impervious to light. 2 inch tan head quickly fades to a light brown ring around the glass. Cinnamon dominates the nose, followed swiftly by Maple and coffee. Cinnamon and maple also dominate upon first sip, coffee moves in afterward and smoothes out the finish. This is definitely a full-bodied beer, carbonation is minimal and perfect. Overall a delicious and flavorful beer, none of the flavors overwhelmed or dominate, they are perfectly mingled together.",4.97
2441,Bourbon Paradise,"Poured a black body with minimal head and touch of lace patches but those quickly dissipate. The aroma is mostly booze to me, although some sugariness comes in as well so assume this is vanilla. Smooth beer, kind of buttery it's so slick, with a hot and boozy taste and feel with vanilla sweetness but also some slickness from hints of coconut.

Taste is incredibly rich vanilla, coconut, milk chocolate, bourbon, and a second wave of coconut on the finish. Feel is absolutely incredible— thick, silky and viscous. It’s like drinking melted chocolate. A pronounced alcohol warmth seals the deal. Make no mistake, this is an incredible beer, but the bourbon finish is almost so rich that it’s a bit unbalanced.

The flavor profile replicates the nose, but I'm impressed by the richness and plush Mouthfeel. This beer is pretty sweet, but the bourbon helps to counter that sweetness a bit. Even so, this is very much a dessert beer, and a sipper at that. Mouthfeel is soft, creamy and full, with a long finish. Alcohol is pretty well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell the abv is up there a bit.",4.4

2469,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Quite a good Bourbon barrel aged beer if anything I guess it could use a touch more barrel character but it really did round out the aggressive hops and roast that the base beer has. Plus I think people are also forgetting how affordable this beer is I picked up a couple cans for under $4 each and that is quite a steal for such a treatment. Sure it may not be 100 out of 100 but it is still a very smooth easy drinking bba stout.,4.68

More chocolate leading the way. More hints of vanilla coming from the oak. More cherries and dark fruits. Some raisins too. Some molasses. Subtle spiciness. Possibly some hints of rye and black pepper in the mix. The bourbon is subtle but noticeable and blends well with everything. Subtle sweetness. Low bitterness. Solid malt backbone.

roast, and loads of warming, astringent booze. Flavors exceed by a nice

Taste is pretty spicy - brackish Australian licorice, cinnamon, vanilla, and a significant malt backbone. Alcohol is present and warming, and it does help carry some of the spicier flavors. Apart from the alcohol and vanilla notes, however, I didn't feel I was getting a ton out of the barrel. Mouthfeel is huge and chewy, small amount of carbonation.

Taste is a decent balance of slightly smoked and roasted, quite caramelly malt and a huge, sweet cinnamon presence, although the flavor manages just a bit more depth than the nose, with more distinct chocolate, licorice, molasses and dark fruit notes of raisin and fig coming through here, with a good, not too boozy, Bourbon character and hints of vanilla, tobacco and charred oak.

S: Moderate aromas of dark chocolate are present in the nose with notes of bourbon and hints of cinnamon.
T: The taste follows the smell, except that the bourbon and cinnamon flavors are stronger than those of the chocolate and there are some hints of licorice in the finish.
M: It feels a bit more than medium-bodied and silky smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: I found this beer to be incredibly drinkable as any traces of alcohol were well hidden from the taste and it didn't really have much in the way of licorice flavors.",4.43

Smells of some medium roast coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, spices, a hint of bourbon. Taste follows the nose, but I was expecting more depth and balance and this just didn’t quite do it for me. Don’t get me wrong, it was solid, just not mind blowing.

2538,The Rusty Nail,"Pours black with a finger of tan-khaki head. Head retention is good. Aroma is cinnamon, chocolate, molasses and roasty coffee with hearty roasty and toasty malts underneath. Bourbon accompanied with a heavy char kiss closes out the aroma. Flavor profile is chocolate heavy with cinnamon, vanilla bean and molasses. Roasty and toasty malts add the firm base with oats rounding out this sippable meal. Bourbon adds that spicy swell of heat, which is accompanied hand-in-hand with char.

The nose is full of licorice. A hint of cinnamon. Some vanilla. Some caramel. Some raisin.
Taste - Oh my! This is a flavor bomb, and I know I won't do justice to it. Licorice, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cinnamon, raisin, and even more that I can't quite pin down that just all work together perfectly.
Smooth as hell. Thick, rich, full bodied. Minimal alcohol burn.

T: Semi-dry. The palate basically following the nose closely, again with strong barley presence. Bitterness understated.

This is a really yummy beer, but it's not as rich or flavorful as many other Tree House offerings. Some folks really loved the smell of Alter Ego, but I found this to be the weak spot in this beer. It was a little murky and sour for my nose. But the taste was delicious, with a nice balance of dank bitterness and sweet/citrus fruit flavors. The feel, while a touch on the light side, was very smooth. The look was a slightly hazy orange - hazier than Bright, but less hazy than most other TH IPAs.",4.29

2570,Coconut Vibes,Batch 3. Bottled a few months ago.,4.42
2571,Coconut Vibes,"Sweet AF, but you know that going in... the coconut is on point, body thick and oily, still super sweet. While the coconut is prominent, there is a lot more going on with bittersweet chocolate, muted coffee and some sweetness. Overall a great beer but definitely for sharing.",4.78
2572,Coconut Vibes,"This one pours a syrupy and inky looking dark black color, with basically no head or lacing.",4.28
2573,Coconut Vibes,Motor oil black with burnt brown edges and no head but for some floating chunks of coconut lipids.,3.97
2574,Coconut Vibes,"750ml bottle, batch 2. Supposedly 4x the coconut addition of the first batch. It shows, it has way too much coconut in it, which doesn't mesh very well with the big chocolate fudge of the base beer. It is too intense on both counts, which normally is not a bad thing but they just don't really balance well with each other. It's too sweet and weirdly cloying. Full bodied, creamy, thick and viscous- but the coconut and the imperial stout just didn't work. I think it just needed the barrel aging to really smooth it out and add something to break up the weird duopoly of sweet coconut and sweet chocolate malt.",4.23
2575,Coconut Vibes,"Very viscous like motor oil on the pour. Opaque with a modest dark tan head that settled quickly. Aroma was full-on pastry with rich chocolate, salted caramel, faint coconut, and vanilla. Taste followed. Very thick and dessert-like. Flavors were bright, although on my palate the coconut tasted more like a sweet marshmallow compliment to the chocolate. Delicious and well-executed but I prefer less sweetness on the end.",4.21
2576,Coconut Vibes,"It is absolutely mind-blowing how thick this beer is - it's surprising that a Russian imperial stout bears absolutely not trace of hop or bitterness... it's smooth, thick, and rich, with loads of chocolate and coconut. I'd love to drink this every day, but it's so much sensory overload that it blows up your palate. Also, diabetes.",4.8
2577,Coconut Vibes,"L: Outrageously thick oily pour with a thin rust-colored head
S: Toasted coconut and suntan lotion
T: Liquid almond joy - copious coconut that is amply complemented by heavy doses of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and cacao nibs with a slight nutty finish
F: Thick and chewy
O: Incredible beer - Blend #2 lived up to the hype for me. While it was very coconut-forward (as expected), I was surprised by the range and complexity of chocolate flavors. Very well executed and among one of the best non-BA stouts I've ever had the opportunity to drink. Well done.",4.93

If you love Last Snow, Fantastic Voyage or Death by Coconut, this beer is on a whole other level. You can even make a case that this beer might be the very best non-barrel aged adjunct stout every produced. Simply amazing.",5

2582,Coconut Vibes,"The beer pours a Pitch Black with a thin khaki head that recedes quickly. It has low carbonation. The beer smells of toasted coconut, chocolate syrup, and walnuts. It tastes of toasted coconut, chocolate syrup, and walnuts. It has a medium full body, but very smooth. Lots of coconut as advertised, did not lose a step after 6 monthes.",4.62

2585,Coconut Vibes,"Another vibes outing from Shared, this time with coconut. Shared with the Mrs., this pours pitch black, with a dark tan head if aggressive. Wife had a good amount of coconut ""floaties"". Strong malt bill on the nose, intermixed with coconut and a hint of alcohol. Very big and rich on the palate, with a flavor that coats the mouth and stays. Once again, there is a bit of coconut, but I was also pleasantly surprised with a good amount of chocolate. Overall, very enjoyable.",4.62

2587,Coconut Vibes,"from the cask over at the cellar, my golly this is incredible. more intensely flavored and i think more dynamic than either of the coffee variants i have had of this one, and frankly one of the better coconut stouts i have ever come across. the cask pour obviously favors a beer like this, frothy, at perfect temperature, and with an even more silky texture that i think adds to the allure, but the beer is insane regardless of the format. the coconut is definitely toasted, it has that warming, baked, nutty an sweet quality to it, really strongly dosed but also extremely natural, a new benchmark for natural coconut aroma and flavor for sure in one of these. its got just the right amount of sweetness in it, and it brings a chocolate covered sort of vibe out of the malt, both dark and milk, roasty and rich at the same time, and while this is assuredly bitter from the malt at the end, it is far less so than the coffee variants were, just mellow, almost oak aged taste to the finish from the grain. so much body but its pillowy soft, starchy and heavy but also relaxing and creamy and awesome, the perfect feel for these flavors. coconut gets more toasty and earthy later on, and it ramps up with the booze as the temperature rises and it opens up awhile in the glass. an enormously impressive and delicious beer, incredible amounts of coconut to this, scary drinkable for its strength, and just a monument to quality. among the best of the shared beers i have had to date!",4.55

2591,Last Buffalo In The Park,"Both last snow and this in the same year, neat! Jet black body with a brown head, standard but well done. Huge coconut right away in the nose, bourbon is present but light, get bakers chocolate and caramel more. Taste is surprisingly similar, while coconut laden nose is fun, want more barrel for the taste. Malt work stabilizes the complexion though, with velvet smooth coffee setting in near the finish. The feel is very smooth, but it is light in both body and barrel, coconut defines somehow even more than LS. Like last snow better, but still a nice porter. Coconut fans this one is for you!",4.29

Smells of chocolate, vanilla coconut, roasty malts.
Taste is creamy coffee, vanilla, coconut, a hint of bourbon.
Nice creamy full body, I wish all porters were this way.
Overall an excellent beer, maybe my favorite porter to date!",4.63
2600,Last Buffalo In The Park,"I have had a few of these through the years, always excellent but for whatever reason 2019 feels a bit boozy at the end, prior years loved the roasty grainy after taste. Still better than 90-95% of what is out there.",4.48
2601,Last Buffalo In The Park,"The look and mouthfeel of this beer are world class.
Where things falls apart is the same old story with every Funky Buddha beer I’ve tried, that cheap, chemical flavor from the adjuncts. It tastes like the beer equivalent of fast food.",3.63
2602,Last Buffalo In The Park,"I love Last Snow. Unfortunately while in the Tampa area this past March there was none that I could find. This beeer is courtesy of my friend and BA icon @DoctorZombies. Thank you my friend. There is only one rason this beer does not get a 5 and that is because no beer is perfect. This is damn close.It may be a touch on the sweet side but it just works. Oh, if only I had a cellar full I would be giddy !",4.75
2603,Last Buffalo In The Park,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is big, bold coconut right at the forefront. Vanilla bean quickly follows coconut. What happens next is a mixture of gift shop fudge, toffee and coffee and hearty stout malts, with notes of toffee, molasses, caramel, coffee and roasty, toasty, caramely malts charging through. There is a very light whiskey heat on the edge, but it melds into the background well. Flavor profile continues to push the coconut heavy narrative, with vanilla bean coming on second. Between the two, the onset is very sugary. The remainder of the flavor profile works its way back towards balanced by order of notes of toffee, caramel, molasses, coffee, and roasty, toasty malts. Whiskey starts to come on at the end to boil away some of the sugar. Whiskey melds in well, never coming off as hot or out of place. Mouth feel is thick with a grainy velvety texture that feels decadent each and every sip. Overall, boisterous with a lot going on, with coconut and vanilla bean at the helm.",4.47
2604,Last Buffalo In The Park,"Black in color with no light penetration. There’s a fingernail of beige around the rim and just a trace of it showing elsewhere. The aroma is of coconut and bourbon.

2605,Last Buffalo In The Park,"Pouring this from a 22 oz. bottle into a snulip glass, this beer pours out like a dark brewed coffee, with little wood like highlights running throughout. It forms a thin crown of bubbles that are khaki in color and dissipate quickly. 3.75",4.52
2606,Last Buffalo In The Park,"A slick black color with a frothy brown head. These guys seem to make some of the most strongly smelling dark beers that I have ever had. Big notes of coffee, chocolate, and spices. The drinking starts smooth and silky upfront with tons of lush chocolate malts. A smooth flow that finishes ever so slightly bitter. The coffee falls on the subtle side but the highlight flavor is clearly the coconut. I love coconut and the flavor comes off spot on genuine. Additional notes of tannin, smoke, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, cocoa powder, and smoke. The mouth feel is superb- full bodied with such a lush and silky feel. Not overly sweet and not terribly sticky but enough to still allow the flavors to linger nicely after each sip. A slight alcohol burn on the finish but otherwise the abv hides very well and it's really warming me up.",4.57

Unquestionably a dessert beer.",4.47

T: Taste is smooth and malty before the grapefruit comes in with full force. Very juicy but also slightly pithy with a touch of sweetness. Swallow is more juicy grapefruit and citrus with some lingering citrus zest on the finish.
M: This beer has a medium body with carbonation that is just slightly prickly while the beer finishes on the oily and refreshing side due to all the hops along with a little sweet malt.
O: Overall this is a top notch DIPA. Great flavors and some decent complexity though the grapefruit note is definitely the star of the show. A very clean and balanced DIPA as well. One to try if you like citrusy DIPAs and can get your hands on it.",4.62

Met the hype, and worth the hunt!",4.6
2657,Miami Madness,"5's across the board. No doubt about it. This blows all other Berliners I have tried right out of the water.
L: looks just like an orange juice/passion fruit juice. Great, bright, solid dark-yellow appearance.
S: This is where it hit me hard! HUGE aromas of passion fruit and guava right up from. The mango is perfectly evident as well. Citrus. Nice subtle funkiess. One of those things that make your mouth water just smelling it.
T: Fantastic! Great heavy flavors of passion fruit and guava with a nice sour/tart funkiness. Sour mouthburst was not too subtle, and not overpowering, so it was easy to work my way through the whole bottle. Again the mango was evident but backseat to the other two fruits.
F: mouthfeel was just smooth enough (not too sharp), and the aftertaste was tart and juicy.
Overall, this was one of the best beers I have had this year. I was already a big fan of passion fruit, but this beer really nailed it. Wholeheartedly worth the effort to get this, and I will be pursuing more of this in the future!",5
2658,Miami Madness,"One of the best berliners I've had. Aroma of fruit and a little tart, but the flavors were really where this brew shines. The slight tart and funk was an excellent companion to the tropical fruit flavors. Made everything just pop on the palate. Delicious",4.78

2663,Miami Madness,"really well done berliner type with tropical fruit. its one of the better fruity berliners i have had, and one of the best uses of these fruits i have seen in any beer, and while i loved it, im not sure it ranks among the best beers i have ever had overall, and wasnt even my favorite beer from j wakefield, although its probably still deserving of most of its hype! doesnt look like much, orange and hazy, quite thick for a beer so low in alcohol. the aroma is shocking, intensely sour, acidic, mouthwatering, puckery, all of it. with the passion fruit leading the charge, but the other fruits quite authentic and obvious in the aroma as well, juicy and intense, really different from other beers, more and more fresh. the flavor matches the aroma, with a real intense fruity complexion, passion fruit and orange and mango for sure, all really alive and bold in here, but never too sweet. thats the brilliance i think, keeping it dry. it doesnt feel light to me though, lots of body and texture, and even the high acidity doesnt lighten it up much. surprised its so clean too, gone but the palate begs for another gulp as soon as it is swallowed. this is not a style i usually flock to, especially with these fruits, where more often than not its gimmick over quality. this is awesomely delicious, a leader in its class no doubt!",4.37

Unfortunately compared to stuff now it is extremely thin and way too boozy to be enjoyable. There are some good characteristics of bourbon, sweetness, and fudge. When there weren’t as many options I can see why this beer was great. I don’t know if my pallet has changed or the beer landscape has changed, maybe a little bit of both. There are a wide variety of better ba stouts in smaller formats that are more enjoyable in all aspects right now to have this again unless it was a really well aged bottle.",3.59

Small mocha head forms and dissipates quickly, probably running from the 20.5% abv (haha). Aromas of caramel, fudge, oak and booze fill my nose. Set the glass on the table a few feet away and I could still smell it. Taste is all of the above....lots of fudge, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oakiness and some definite booze. For 20.5%, I expected some heat, even with a 3 yr old beer. Drinks thicker than it looks. Coated the mouth with vanilla, caramel and booze. Overall, even with the hints of booziness there, this is still relatively smooth. Excellent beer.",4.53
2675,Black Tuesday - Reserve,"A: Poured into a snifter to a deep black topped by a half finger of dense dark tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of boozy bourbon with caramel, vanilla and oak leading the charge. There's also some chocolate and a little coffee in there from the roasted malts along with some slight smoke.
T: Taste is chocolate and coffee with roasted malts, a slight licorice note on top of some caramel, vanilla and oak. Faint smoke plays with some toasted marshmallows and a little coconut. Alcohol is there as well. Slight raisin note can be found here as well. Swallow is more roasted malts, oak, chocolate, raisin, dark cherry, caramel, vanilla, and oak.
M: This beer is big and sticky on the palate with carbonation that is so low it almost isn't there. The beer has a very dry finish due to the huge ABV. Residual sugar is still plentiful though.
O: And the hits just keep coming. The amount of complexity this beer is showing is insane. Great depth and breadth of flavors and well balanced. I'm happy they will be making this again because this is too good to be just a one time thing.",4.75

One of the best out there.",5

2690,Notorious Triple IPA,"Wow. Usually double IPAs are too strong for me. This is a triple IPA. And yet it is delicious! It is incredibly strong, but you have to expect that. It's like drinking port, if port was really really good and tasted like an excellent IPA.",4.11

2730,Blåbær Lambik,Lots of people told me to not believe the hype on this beer. I just think it's impossible to get the strong blueberry taste like you do with a peach or raspberry lambic. This beer was one of the best blueberry lambic/sours I've ever had. I had it along side a lot of different blueberry beers and this one was one of the top 3. the funk was soft and the sour notes were very light but it was very smooth and I'd definitely trade high for this again,4.75

2735,Blåbær Lambik,"Pours a rich bluish, purple with healthy blueberry yogurt head. Bottom of cork and nose smells like spontaneous funk with minimal barnyard mustiness but with healthy blueberry aroma. Taste is young lambic citric acidic sourness with big tannic presence, a bit of lacto, and slight but real blueberry undertones. Mouthfeel is full but the finish is very bitter and dry. Overall, this is one of the best blueberry beers I've had but it's a difficult fruit to conquer. Age would tone down the bitterness and let the lambic base come around but would likely diminish the amazing nose and kill the fruit from the taste. Great beer but I prefer many of Cantillon's other offerings.",4.63
2736,Blåbær Lambik,"The blueberry taste was a little more subdued than I expected, but despite that it's still a fantastic beer. Goes without saying that it feels pretty cool to notch this one off my bucket list - it helps to have friends who are connected!",4.47
2737,Blåbær Lambik,"L: Deep, dark purple hue with a nice amount of carb retention after the pour. Gorgeous.
S: Tons of that lovely Cantillon funk with a complimenting undertone of fruit that smooths out the nose.
T: Similar to smell; perfect funkiness, and just the slightest hint of juicy blueberry. The most authentic blueberry flavor I've ever experienced in a beer.
F: Great carb level; does just enough to cut through the juicy funk so that the taste both coats and lingers for further enjoyment.
Overall, this lived beyond what I had expected. Blueberry is such a difficult flavor to impart into beer, and Cantillon, once again, blew me away. I'm stingy with chasing down hyped beers, but this is one I would recommend again and again.",4.85
2738,Blåbær Lambik,"Bottle. I believe it to be 2015. Poured a ruddy, muddy purple. Almost wine like. A purple/pink frothiness that sits atop the beer. Aroma promises a very sour aspect to the beer. Earth, vinegar, wood, and of course, a mixture of ripe perfumey blueberries and underripe, tart blueberries. The flavor was probably not as complex as other Cantillon beers I have had but it was surely impressive and flooring. It starts off very tart. A bright pop of sourness that has a balsamic quality folds into a display of woody blueberry wine. I loved how dry it finished. Each sip was better than the last as my palate adjusted to the potency of flavor. The body was light and the tartness lingered. Probably won't have this again so it was definitely a treat.",4.65

At first the smell is lactose sweet but as it warms up you get some strong chocolate notes and just a hint of chili pepper. The smell did not prepare you for the explosion of taste when you finally sip it. Sweet chocolate on the front end with a sweet cinnamon Center. Not really any heat to speak of but there are some pepper notes. Not really any specific maple flavor but it is definitely sweet. It feels a touch watery but still has a modicum of body.

2764,Mexican Brunch,"this is a killer beer, quite deserving of its highly regarded status, and a pretty righteous use of maple syrup, but i think i just like their sunday brunch better. i lose quite a bit of the coffee roasted bitterness here to the spiciness of the chilis and the cinnamon. i mean, there is amazing balance between all the added ingredients here, and you can surely appreciate each element on its own as well as appreciate its contribution to the whole, dont get me wrong, but i liked the simplicity of the coffee and the maple too. the cocoa adds a nice bittering low end along with the roasted malt, and i get a unique floral honey thing in here too, odd in such a huge and flavorful and dark beer, but there it is. the cinnamon is warming with the alcohol, and the maple makes this wintery and cozy. its not overdone, but its awfully flavorful, and probably as close to the line with adjuncts as i like to get most of the time. still really maple forward, but not as driven by it as the sunday brunch is. cool beer, powerfully flavored, neat balance though, and smooth and rich to drink on. these guys have blown me away in limited exposure, i need to find a way to get more of their beers in me! as good as any of the more well known beers made in this style...",4.4

A friend of mine drove all the way to Boston, snagged a bunch of Trillium beer, brought them back to CT, and a sampling we did do. I wish Cutting Tiles wasn't the first one I tried. It reminded me of drinking Dundee's Honey Brown Lager back in high school. I was tempted to ""accidentally"" spill my glass off his deck to avoid further punishment, but there were kids underneath playing laser tag, and I was afraid of spilling it on them. Imagine having to rescue them from a bee attack or a bear attack if they were laced in Cutting Tiles. I thoroughly enjoyed the other varieties, but the 4.5 point World Class reviews for this beer are completely misleading. I think the beer is just riding the coattails of Trillium's other quality recipes. I desperately want to blind taste test some users on this site. This beer is terrible. Save yourself the drive, buy a double Mosaic IPA that somehow tastes like a pilsner, and stir in about a half a cup of honey and there you go, Cutting Tiles. Also, if you like tea and honey, try tea and Cutting Tiles. Oh, and I heard they're partnering with General Mills to make Cutting Tiles Nut Cheerios.

2784,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,"Draft at the brewery.
Presents hazy gold with a minimal head or retention. Dank and fruity in the nose. Garlic and onions with tropical fruit. Medium bodied with a tacky, slightly slick mouthfeel. Garlic-rubbed chives with ripe tropicals on the palate. Finishes with a lingering dankness, a medium bitterness, and a hint of sweet honey.",4.3
2785,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,"Poured a hazy orange with nice lacing... small head .... tastes of honey, mango, light pineapple... very juicy and smells all same .... ever so slight bitter finish more sweet honey ... great overall beer and can’t wait for more .... first trillium experience and couldn’t be happier",4.41
2786,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,"A hazy lemon color with accents of tea. 1 finger of bubbly, puffy head that recedes to a line of bubbles.",3.58
2787,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,"A 1 pint can, with strangely no visible canned on date (looks like it got cut off the side of the can). Can was also quite severely deformed on the top (my fault), which made it extremely hard to open, although I somehow managed it in the end. Doesn’t appear to have affected the beer with no leaks. Poured into a Lost Abbey teku glass.",4.09
2788,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,This beer was solid. Not sure its world class but def i great beer. something about the color made me give it a 5 not sure if its the honey or what,4.58
2789,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,"Trillium is an impressive brewer and this beer is well developed but in my opinion not their best. Pipeworks has devised beers with honey far superior than Cutting Tiles/Artaic such as Sure Bet and even Spotted Puffer. Orange haze, decent head, underwhelming in flavor based on hype. Light/lacking in a zing that I was expecting. Another great beer from Trillium but my conflated expectations spoiled my experience.",4.64
2790,The Peach,"750ml bottle, aged in oak barrels, undated, poured into a stemless wine glass.",4.26
2791,The Peach,"750ml bottle at share. Pale golden/pink, bubbly head. Aroma is stone fruity, peaches, light vanilla. taste brings a little citrus, but mostly the peaches, and a trace of vanilla.",4
2792,The Peach,"one of the beers i have been after for a long time has finally become a reality, definitely one i have been keen on, so cool to have beery friends out there! this is unique in that its not just a peach wild ale, but one aged in cognac barrels, really complex and good. its got a high shine and a pale color, bright but less than fully clear through most of the bottle, some little bubbles coming up, but somewhat unremarkable visually. it smells a bit more sour than a lot of the de garde beers have been in my experience so far, really piquant, slight vinegar character, white wine acidity, clean though, less funky, and i get the cognac immediately, some sweetness and some alcohol warmth to it, with the very natural peach its almost a baked dessert complexion, light vanilla and graham and even tobacco to it, nice complexity but very sour it seems. the peach is crazy juicy and real and ripe, very authentic here, and i knew it would be based on the other fruit beers ive had in the past from these guys, man i wish i had a reliable supply of their stuff! the flavor here is excellent, again more sour than expected, but its a clean and lightly citrusy sourness, it seems built to balance the sweetness of the peach and even highlight its essence, the peach is bold from beginning to end here. the wood is strong, but the beer itself is quite light, minimal on the grain side, the peach really leads the way. the cognac though is an amazing tough, and im not sure this would be anywhere near as exciting without it, despite the obvious quality. its nutty and deeper than the oak alone, a golden raisin hint maybe, a sweet alcoholic layer, even cigar or something in the mix, just crazy, its amazing with the peach. i get a little less of the de garde funk that i like so much, more generic acidity, so i would enjoy more funkiness, but i cant complain. this was awesome overall, different awesome than expected, but great and really distinct with this combination of fruit and barrel. i hate to admit i had a little sinus thing going on and may have not experienced this in its full glory as a result, cant control those things and certainly wasnt going to pass on it, so i will look forward to hopefully having this again. i love this brewery, its always a joy to drink their beers. this appears worthy of its hype!",4.45
2793,The Peach,A- Hazy golden body. Two finger creamy cap with good retention. Small sheets of lacing form after each sip.,4.49
2794,The Peach,Looks hazy orange with a white head. Lots of peach and oak in the flavor. Good balance of tart and sweet - loaded with peach. One of the best sour's I've had.,4.6

2796,The Peach,"Thanks, to either Sam or Brian for this one. September 2018 release, 6.5%",3.97
2797,The Peach,Look: super hazy light yellow orange with a light white head,4.69
2798,The Peach,"This one pours with a very clear light orange hue, with a small head and not much lacing.",4.03
2799,The Peach,"Batch 3
The beer pours a Clear gold with a medium white head. It has medium carbonation. The beer smells tart, peaches, oak, and banana. It tastes tart, with peaches, oak, and light funk. The feel is medium light and dry. A good sour from De Garde, but not one of my favorites from one of my favorite breweries.",4.42
2800,The Peach,"11/2015 - Batch 1 - Love when this warms - the cognac pops incredibly, the peach is lovely, and the funk takes a back seat; more peach, cognac, and barnyard on the palate, with some classic dG funk to round it out; pretty great body, with a lightly sweet, a touch acidic finish.",4.85
2801,The Peach,"Batch 2, I think.",3.94
2802,The Peach,"Something has to have been wrong with my bottle. Poured like jelly, little to no peach flavor, no carbonation. An overall strange experience for sure.",3.03
2803,The Peach,Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head that disipates quickly. Aroma is a sour peach that is very mild and pleasant. Taste is a very nice sour peach.,4.73
2804,The Peach,Batch 2 drank in a snifter on 9/16/2017,4.74
2805,The Peach,"A wild ale's wild Ale. De Garde nailed it on this one. Appearance is a hazy opaque golden orange peach color, absolutely beautiful! This was B1 so the nose was in the face cognac from the moment the bottle was capped ... oh them barrels!! Flavor is big peach, with nice integrated Brandy tones, and the mouthfeel is as rich as a wild Ale can get. Home run with B1 de Garde!",5
2806,The Peach,Bottle on-site at de Garde. This one was as advertised and maybe even better. One of the best fruited wild ales I have ever had. Nearly perfect in execution - incredible fruit flavor and just enough sourness. I liked this better than Nectarine Premiere.,4.75

2810,The Peach,"L: pours almost clear, but a cloudy straw yellow with a film of white head
S: big juicy peach and some sourness. Smells of pure peach, no funk.
T: just like the nose...all clean sour peach. Not funk or barnyard, no straw. This is just like fuzzy from side project.
F: oh man, so drinkable. Not puckering, flavors linger, so drinkable.",4.65
2811,The Peach,Had this alongside the Imperial Apricot Bu. This one wasnt nearly as tart when but it got considerably more tart as it warmed. TONS of peach on the nose and palate here though and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Total Peach Bomb!,4.96
2812,The Peach,Appearance: murky and cloudy bright yellow,4.97
2813,The Peach,"Batch 1 (cognac barrels), poured into a tulip. Juicy peach, just the right amount of barrel/funk. Not overly complex but a delicious beer. Looking forward to comparing with Batch 2.",4.71
2814,The Peach,"Shared with a good buddy in Denver. Little 2 man share so boss pours for both of us. The nose was explosive peach and funk... incredible! Taste followed right along... the most expressive peach sour I have ever had, absolutely mind blowing. We both finished our glasses and immediately posted ISO's haha",5

Double Shot
Tree House Brewing
Date: 18 June 2021
This is the last Tree House beer; I have in my Fridge. Every beer I have consumed thus far has been blown my expectations away. My first stout from Tree House; when I opened the can, a heavy coffee aroma emitted. I poured the beer into my fancy imperial stout glass. The pour created a creamy and foamy dark brown two-fingered head with excellent retention. The color charts around SRM 26, dark brown like used motor oil without the highlights.",4.5
2816,Double Shot,"Pours dark and thick, huge mocha foamy head that lingers. Super sweet coffee and chocolate aroma with a touch of boozy Esa to it. Extremely sweet, has a nice coffee flavor, feels like there is a ton of maple syrup in it. Very sweet. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall a very good beer, but extremely sweet.",4.29
2817,Double Shot,"On tap @ The Festival 2014. Black pour with a small layer of tan foam. A lot of rich, spicy coffee on the nose. Slight vanilla and caramel sweetness. Roast, cocoa powder, and a mild nuttiness. Flavor has a moderate bitterness of coffee, roast, and cocoa. However, a nice sweet balance to it. Plenty of caramel and dried blueberry. I liked this more than the maple one.",4
2818,Double Shot,"Huge thanks to Alan for this one, and plenty of other long time wants. This is one of those beers you just have to try at least once, so here I go!",4.05
2819,Double Shot,"Bottle courtesy of yllib.
Almost black appearance. Dark brown head. Fizzes out quickly.
Smell of chocolate, cream, coffee, burnt grain. Caramel.
Tastes like you would expect. Chocolate, coffee/espresso, toasty malt, caramel notes, vanilla.
Medium silky mouthfeel. A little bitter bite finish.
Overall very nice. Would describe as a milk stout or coffee stout. 9+% abv not present at all.",4.21
2820,Double Shot,"Pours a deep black in color with a finger plus of light brown head that has excellent retention and leaves behind some sporadic sticky lacing. Aroma has roasty, coffee, and chocolate notes. Taste is full of sweet caramel, roasted malts, coffee, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and a touch of bitterness. This is full bodied with moderate carbonation and a sweet, almost syrupy mouthfeel. I really enjoy the aromas and flavors aside form the level of sweetness and syrupy mouthfeel; I’d those were a little dialed back I’d be much happier. I’ve had previously batches and I don’t remember this being quite so sweet.",4.42
2821,Double Shot,"Nom nom nom nom nom. I recently had tried Triple Shot on draft at Tree House, and brought back some cans of Double Shot to try at home. Triple Shot definitely has more coffee flavor, and was maybe a touch smoother, but Double Shot is still phenomenal. Rich, smooth, and the booze is hidden perfectly. A top-notch stout!",4.74
2822,Double Shot,"Incredible stout. I initially rated it as an imperial stout - was fooled by its depth, complexity, flavors and richness - and then when submitting realized my error and had to change accordingly. Knowing that it was actually a stout made it incredibly impressive. 1/24/20 date printed on can. Pours a thick almost sludgy very dark brown, almost black color that was incredibly opaque. Lots of fluffy tan head and some spotty lingering lacing that settled into small soapy rings. Smells amazing, deep dark roast coffee, dark chocolate fudge, vanilla, caramel, bread, malt, roasted nuts, brown sugar, maybe a little stone fruit. Taste follows the nose, incredible depth and balance, again reminded me of an imperial stout. Definitely not like any regular stout I've had before. Smooth, sticky, luscious mouthfeel that coated the palate, good amount of carbonation. No alcohol burn even as the beer warmed. Fantastic!",4.49
2823,Double Shot,"Serving: 16 oz. can poured into a Goose Island pint glass. Canned on 11/27/19 (""I TAKE MY ESPRESSO VERY VERY SERIOUSLY"" edition), making this just over 3 months old at this point.",4.84
2824,Double Shot,Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip,4.42
2825,Double Shot,16 oz. can. Somehow I've never had this or maybe just never reviewed it. Pitch black with an ample mocha head. Looks nice. Smells of coffee and associated acidity. Sharp sweetness. Lots of roasted malt. Tastes of lactose first and primarily. Sweet and sharp lactose sweetness. Coffee immediately behind it. Milk chocolate. Finishes with some lingering roastiness and lactose. Medium heavy. Very sweet. Sharp and sweet lactose are too much for me. Coffee and intense roast character are overshadowed by the lactose.,3.17
2826,Double Shot,Picked up 2 cases of Treehouse 2 weeks ago. Got 4 of these. Drank one before Trekkies wedding last week. This review is based on that beer.,3.89
2827,Double Shot,"16 oz can poured into a snifter. Pours an opaque, oily black. Aroma and flavor are bitter coffee, dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, and sweet vanilla. Very drinkable despite how sweet and thick it comes across.",4.44
2828,Double Shot,"super smooth, creamy, velvet-y, chocolate-milk.... my can says 8.2%, though, as opposed to this site's data and it doesnt even show it. who needs coffee when you have this in the frig waiting? starbucks should stock up on this!",4.75
2829,Double Shot,"Picked-up a single can at Tree House Brewery in Charlton for $8.05. My fifty eighth brew from these guys. Very fine beer, pinging a bit due to extremely high cost.",4.25
2830,Double Shot,16oz can poured into a snifter.,3.86
2831,Double Shot,"pours out a dark brown - black color, deep brown tinged brown head, sort of fizzy but hangs around for a while.",4.6
2832,Double Shot,"Pours a dark brown with tan head. It smells of intense coffee. No bitterness at all to this. Just fudgey chocolate and coffee. Smooth as hell. It's very approachable in the way that every Tree House is approachable. This no doubt tastes great and is super smooth, but it is also the type of coffee stout that people who don't drink coffee stouts would like. It's not super complex and has one note of those three flavors.",4
2833,Double Shot,"Drank from a 500 ml (1 pt .9 fl. oz) bottle purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
Served in a snifter",4.65
2834,Double Shot,"Pours opaque, dark brown in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is dark roast coffee, chocolate, and light vanilla. Heavy bodied, roasty with moderate carbonation. Solid coffee stout with plenty of coffee flavor. You can tell this is the base for their other sweet stout. Above average. Plenty of coffee taste for coffee drinkers.",3.83
2835,Double Shot,"A- 500ml pours into a tulip glass with a tar black body and a deep brown, thick and creamy head. The cap makes it to just over a finger at its peak and has good retention. A few webs of lacing coat the glass.",4.43
2836,Double Shot,"Just lucked out on being in the right place at right time as I was driving from Fl to Me. I honestly didn’t know that TH did stouts as I have only been at the new brewery one time before. I am so glad that I got this one. My fav beers are RIP’s, stouts and the dark styles and TH really hit a home run with this for me . This is OMG good. A wonderful blend of things that all work together beautifully. I only bought two bottles and now wish I had bought more as I am sipping it for the first time. Just had the second bottle, 8/31/19 and I liked even more than the first bottle. Had to kick my wife and dog out of a fully packed car to buy more. Just didn’t have a good feel to leaving my wife and dog at Tree House. Bummer.",4.46
2837,Double Shot,"Traded for this and a few other bottles from Tree House this week, as I never had anything dark and heavy from them before. Although the Vanilla Bean take on this was better, this was a solid beer that felt like sensual coffee in a bottle. If you like your beer to be roasted, slick, and complemented by appropriate flavors, then you've found your match right here!",4.43
2838,Double Shot,"Very pretty pour: thick, black, and fizzy, with a retentive chocolate brown head.",4.81
2839,Double Shot,"absolutely fantastic, everything I hoped it would be! Looks like a perfect (Double) shot of espresso, with a dark caramel colored head. Wonderful coffee aroma which comes though perfectly without any boozieness that a lot of stouts tend to carry.",5
2840,Samuel Adams Utopias,2019 vintage,4.37
2841,Samuel Adams Utopias,"Excited to finally have a Utopias. Only a 2019 but the experience of unboxing it and pouring the bottle is second to none. Sharing this bottle with my bud Rug. Based off looks, phenomenal. Never before had to unbox a beer. Smells strong, gives a bourbon vibe and hints of cinnamon. Slightly burns to smell but that’s to be expected with a beer of this alcohol percentage. Tastes strongly of maple syrup, and bourbon. Hints of cinnamon in the background. Medium feel, finishes sticky. Overall a phenomenal experience. Not anything phenomenal to the senses, but one any craft beer fan should have.",3.91
2842,Samuel Adams Utopias,"2007 vintage - First opened July 4, 2021 - Review on July 6, 2021.",4.97
2843,Samuel Adams Utopias,"It's the Port wine of the beer world, well sort of. It drinks more like a liquor than a beer, no carbonation, no creamy head just a viscous high alcohol punch in the sinuses. It's a great beer to experience if you can get enough folks to split the cost because this bottle ain't cheap.",4.71
2844,Samuel Adams Utopias,"Sample from bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Beautiful chestnut colour. No carbonation, and accordingly no head. INTENSE aroma of port wine, dark dried fruits and fusel alcohols. The latter unfortunately detracts from the aroma score. Intense, concentrated and sweet flavour of old madeira, raisins / rum-raisin and oak.",3.93
2845,Samuel Adams Utopias,"I've only had this at Extreme Beer Fest. I wouldn't usually go for something like this, but it is legend. My endorsement of it is that I immediately got back in line for another taste, which I didn't do for too many others at Extreme.",4.44
2846,Samuel Adams Utopias,"Why this is defined as a beer I have NO idea as it should be a liquor. Amazing alcohol content and it is certainly in my face. I had heard a lot about it and am certainly glad I was able to try it but would never shell out that kind of money to buy it. If it was $25/bottle I still would be unlikely to buy it unless I served it as an after dinner drink kind of thing. Sounds like I didn’t like it, I did, but it’s a niche beer for my tastes and it’s just not a niche I need.",4.68
2847,Samuel Adams Utopias,There is a great balance between a raisiny and balanced sweetness as well as a barleywine type flavor. This comes with a screwtop so is almost like drinking a bottle of scotch or bourbon.,4.74
2848,Samuel Adams Utopias,From the 2016 Vintage bottle in a Seventh Son taster via Bluejacket---Cheers!,4.6
2849,Samuel Adams Utopias,"Served in a tiny snifter. Dark amber with no carbonation or head. Smells of a fine tawny port, caramel, toffee. Taste is the same with a hint of vanilla.",4.99
2850,Samuel Adams Utopias,"This was an awesome experience, Finding the unicorn and then getting to taste it made my New Years Day extra special. I never thought that I would ever have this and then i did, The flavor is rich and delicious. I tasted a hint of fruit/caramel maybe, definitely decadent. This has made it's way to the #1 all time spot on my list. I don't believe anything will ever come close.",4.89
2851,Samuel Adams Utopias,"2019-12-29
2017 bottle served in tiny snifters. Pours a Clear caramel Amber color with no head or carbonation. Smell is alcohol, toffee, dates, oak. Taste is all that plus sweet, fruity, and alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is light and and smooth. Overall, really interesting, tasty beery that is more Sherry than beer.",4.45
2852,Samuel Adams Utopias,Pours light copper. Clear. No head or lacing. Looks more like a cognac than a beer.,5
2853,Samuel Adams Utopias,"A-Pours a dark amber color with no head or lacing
A-Aroma has oak and smoke hints
T-the taste follows the nose with oak and smoke flavors
T-A heavy bodied beer not unlike a brandy
O-A great American Strong Ale",4.55
2854,Samuel Adams Utopias,"Not a beer, but an experience. Got my hands on a 2019 bottle. Don’t know if it will last out the year. I’m not going to describe it terms of flavors, more of what it reminds me of. It’s like a finely aged twenty year old port or a cognac without a big alcohol burn. It’s smooth, it’s rich, it’s bold and big and boozy and thick and just all around amazing. This was a long time want, and it lives up to everything I’ve wanted it to. Simply one of the best beers I’ve ever had.",5
2855,Samuel Adams Utopias,"2017 Bottle:
L - Dark ruby amber with a good amount of clarity - no real head to speak of.
S - rich caramel, dark fruits, oak, smoke, some alcohol on the nose. Some toffee and vanilla as well
T - Largely follows the nose but incredibly complex. Huge caramel and butterscotch notes, dark fruits, toffee, smoke and oak, vanilla - tastes very much like a rich port
F - Medium bodied with no real carbonation to speak of. Sticky but smooth and buttery.
O - Truly an experience. An incredibly complex beer that tastes more like a port or cherry, but fantastic nonetheless.",4.56
2856,Samuel Adams Utopias,"Not sure this should be classified as beer, just saying. 2019 version poured from the really cool bottle into a 4oz. tasting glass - looks like a tiny glass of amaretto.Nose is boozy sweetness. Taste is complicated by the booziness, maybe an exponentially intensified flavor profile. Yeah ,that's it. 20+ years of aging and blending. There is nothing to compare this to.",4.55
2857,Samuel Adams Utopias,Clear amber brown. No head.,4.35
2858,Samuel Adams Utopias,"This is my only perfect score.
The pure genius of its design and execution put it in a special place.
I'm lucky to be on my 4th bottle.
All credit to James Koch, a true pioneer.
Enjoy the the aroma, feel and flavors on all parts of your tongue.
Nothing in the world like it.",5
2859,Samuel Adams Utopias,"First time seeing it available around here, so “had to” pony up the money for a tiny 1 oz taste. The smell was literally filling the area around the bottle. Nose started like four feet away. Caramel notes, cologne. Color is rich, clear, rusty amber. First sip is boozy, reminds me of cognac, with a solid pitted fruit on the front, caramelly vanilla in back. It looks thin, but it’s actually very viscous and leaves some heavy legs. Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp, cleansing bite from the alcohol. It really is not like what one would think of as a traditional strong ale, but more a spirit / liquor. One ounce leaves one wanting more, but it was a real treat.",5
2860,Samuel Adams Utopias,"I know it looks foolish to do all 5s. But this ""beer"" is off the charts. The taste is more like a (non-carbonated) sherry-cognac with a maple overtone. At 28% alcohol, these brews last for a very long time. My collection goes back 10 years. The 2009, opened for a decade, still tastes great. I just have tiny sips, so I can extend the experience over the years.",5
2861,Samuel Adams Utopias,"Shared 2017 canister.
Fabulous, very complex
aroma.
Caramel, toffee, dates, whisky, prunes, subtle roasted nuts appear in both the aroma and the flavor.
Overall. Lives up to the hype, if not the price.",4.49
2862,Samuel Adams Utopias,"8000th review! 8 ounce pour from a 24 ounce bottle; 2017 vintage bottling. Bottle #14819. Pours still, slightly hazy ruby reddish/orange/copper color. No head or lacing, but tons of alcohol legs on the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Increasing booze in the aromas, but not too overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Taste of huge raisin, plum, prune, cherry, fig, date, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, cognac, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, and brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light oak char bitterness, and barrel tannin/alcohol spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of dark fruits, cherry, apricot, berries, red grape, port, sherry, rum, brandy, bourbon, coconut, toasted oak, honey, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, biscuit, roasted nuts, brown bread/crust, licorice, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, oak char, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, peppercorn, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; with a great malt/oak spiciness balance, and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering barrel tannin and spicy alcohol. Fairly full body; with a smooth, creamy/slick, and lightly syrupy/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Light-moderate increasing warmth of 28%, some lingering barrel booze after the finish; but not overwhelming. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged strong ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malts, fruity yeast, and multiple barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the enormous ABV. As expected this is like a cross between beer and all above mentioned spirits. Mind blowing amounts of complexity; and everything is perfectly integrated with all the different barrels. A highly amazing offering, and world class beer for what it was. A truly unique experience.",4.38
2863,Samuel Adams Utopias,"The odd beer that smells better than it tastes. No issue as both are excellent. Medium dark color, nice head. Don't overdo this one, drinks more like a liquor than a beer.",4.7
2864,Samuel Adams Utopias,"Pours a clear chestnut color, no carbonation. One of the most amazing aromas I have ever had the privledge of enjoying. Tons of burnt sugar, dark fruits, raisins, molasses, dark brown sugar, nutty. I found myself smelling the small snifter well after the liquid was drank. It didn’t taste nearly as good as it smelled, which was fine. A little goes a long way with this beverage. It is delicious, but I would never buy a bottle. But, if a bar is pouring it, I am all in.",4.5
2865,Pirate Bomb!,"Black in color with no penetration to light. There’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and and covering a third of the top. The aroma is of chilies, rum, and coffee. I’m tasting chilies, vanilla, cacao, and rum. The mouth is warm from the chilies and otherwise chewy.",4.15
2866,Pirate Bomb!,"12 oz. bottle, marked 07/27/19, sampled 05/09/21. A little long to wait, bought it off the shelf 3 weeks ago, so the brewer takes any hits on aging, they left it there for purchase.",3.61
2867,Pirate Bomb!,"On tap at Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Pitch black colour, low tan head. Aroma first of fusel alcohols, then molasses, rum oak cask, vanilla, coconut, chocolate and roast malts. Rich and warming mouthfeel. Outstanding flavour, medium sweet and roasty, no sign of fusel, otherwise all the delicious notes from the aroma are repeated and strengthened here. Nice chili heat in the finish. Perfect!",4.44

2875,Pirate Bomb!,"Amazing beer, but the nose is nonexistent. Taste is so balanced with a great level of sweetness. Limited carbonation, and excellent overall. Had at Bangers in Austin, TX on the tap.",4.6
2876,Pirate Bomb!,"Really really good, super thick coating mouthfeel with tons of chocolate coffee and a little bit of the chili pepper coming in on the finish. The rum barrel was a great idea for this beer. The barrel is very pronounced and compliments the base beer really well. This was a great idea for this beer, I like it better than regular bomb.",4.65
2877,Pirate Bomb!,"Poured moderately hard from a bottle into a snifter glass, barely resulting in a bit of brown head that faded soon. Color was practically black, even while pouring. Smells of chile peppers and a bit of chocolate. Taste is a background of rum, some cocoa, and mild chile peppers with mild heat. Not enough heat to leave my mouth warm though. Medium to thick bodied with light carbonation. Can't tell it's 15% ABV, but definitely strong. Amazing stout as usual from Prairie, wish there were more rum barrel stouts like this.",4.6
2878,Pirate Bomb!,"Pours a silky ink black with almost no head. Aroma hits hard with the chili pepper, spice, some coffee grounds and a vague vanilla oak. The palate is very muscular upfront with burnt coffee & seared pepper, it is a little overwhelming - once you power through that initial onslaught there is some cinnamon, coconut husk, rum booziness to add layers. Ultimately it is a beer with a lot of depth but those top notes are just a tad bullying, especially the chili pepper. Thicky and fudgy mouthfeel.",4.28
2879,Pirate Bomb!,"I LOVE this breweries Imperial Stouts and when I find them I am never disappointed. This is no exception. Smooth, almost no head when I poured it. Tasty and I hope they have some left when I go back to the Total Wine here in Fl.",4.52
2880,Pirate Bomb!,"A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a collar of dark tan bubbles around the edge of the glass and some wisps of lacing on the surface.
S: Moderate to strong aromas of rum are present in the nose along with hints of coffee and chili peppers.
T: The taste follows the smell and has moderately strong flavors of rum that stand out in front of those of the coffee beans and chili peppers.
M: It feels full-bodied and somewhat smooth and slick on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer definitely seems strong with all of the aromas and flavors of rum, but tastes more like something that is 10% than 15% abv.",4.26
2881,Pirate Bomb!,"Pours as black as ink with a 2 finger thick foamy brown colored head that made crackling sounds as it dissipated in average time, leaving minimal spotty lacing. The smell is really complex and rich with woody notes, dark rum, coconut, chocolate syrup, vanilla, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, piney accents, molasses, chili peppers and more sweet chocolate aromas. Wonderfully put together, the rum and extra vanilla notes kick it up a notch and make it a better version of the original Bomb!.",4.74

2884,Pirate Bomb!,"A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a small tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with no lacing. Based on the pour this one seems pretty low in carbonation,
S: Smells of a lot of coffee and chocolate with some vanilla and a hint of rum. Touch of peppery heat on the nose too,
T: Taste is coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, peppery heat, some oak and rum barrels. On the swallow there's more rum barrel, chocolate, coffee, vanilla and some lingering heat.
M: This beer is pretty full in body with a slightly silky feel on the palate. Carbonation is on the low end but still adequate while the beer has a slightly drying finish due to the ABV.
O: This beer is delicious. Great adjunct flavors with some nice influence from the base beer. Very well balanced and really nice barrel influence without overpowering the rest of what is going on either. This is definitely one to try if you can get your hands on it.",4.75
2885,Pirate Bomb!,"Pours pitch black, quite viscous and thick. Great chocolate aroma accented by some coffee and coconut. Tastes great. For 15%, it isn’t as sweet as I thought it would be. Loads of chocolate, sweet vanilla, light coffee, heat is light in the background, rum barrel aging works some coconut into the finish. Full bodied and delicious, a little pricy but worth trying once...",4.5
2886,Pirate Bomb!,"Poured from a bottle into a stemmed tulip. Pours black with a decent brown head that fizzes away quickly. Mostly rum on the nose. Faint hints of chocolate. Even as it warms the taste is mostly rum, tobacco, leather. Some chocolate and very slight vanilla sweetness at the end. A subtle warmth from the chilies and a little harshness from the alcohol, which is steep. Light to medium body. Would like a bit more balance as the barrel overpowers a tad. Great if rum is your jam.",4.09
2887,Pirate Bomb!,"look: Dark brown, cola highlights when held to light. Modest tan head with messy lacing.
smell: a nose bomb of roasty char, espresso, and dark chocolate.
taste: Much like the nose, a flavor bomb, great balance of bitter roasty espresso, and chocolate sweetness. Slight pepper burn in the finish. Amazingly drinkable for a rich and ballsy stout.",4.71
2888,Pirate Bomb!,"Bottled 7/22/19. Poured at 55 degrees. Dark brown rocky foam briefly sits atop black liquid; no cap retention; barely a thin ring; no lace; medium legs on swirl. Strong spicy green chillies, rum and chocolate; hot boozy exhale. Taste follows nose and add vanilla, oak and mild roast coffee in the middle; rum soaked chocolate Mexican cake finish. Silky feel, medium body, moderate minus carbonation; warming from 15% ABV. Overall super well balanced, lots of heat from the peppers and alcohol with plenty of chocolate and vanilla to round out the whole; and the nose/flavors stay strong from first sip to last. Worthy of the premium price paid.",4.7

S: Rum and vanilla.
T: Touch of coconut, but mostly roasted flavours, vanilla and warming rum.
F: Thick and chewy, some heat from the alcohol.
O: A very pleasant beer that showcases that bourbon isn't the only barrel for a stout.",4.5
2892,Pirate Paradise,"Pours black, little bit of light brown foam. Smell of high quality rum, tobacco, coconut. Thick, smooth, and fairly sharp boozy. Taste is rum forward, the good way. Sweet, herbal, coconut and plenty of licorice. Not as paradisial as I was expecting.",4.29

2894,Pirate Paradise,"Prairie Pirate Paradise Imperial Stout, 13% ABV. Pours black with a ring of brown bubbles, typical for a Prairie stout. Nose is rum, coconut, and chocolate.

2895,Pirate Paradise,"A thing of beauty.
One of those beer that I could smell all day. It's so complex and gourmet on the nose.
Pitch black on the eye,
Cocoa, rum, vanilla on the nose, very powerful and complex.
A lot on the vanilla in taste, a bit roasted. Very balanced.
The mouthfeel is velvety.
Glad I shared this with some good friends but sad that I had only the one.",4.7

2899,Pirate Paradise,I hate this beer. I just paid $10 for 1 12 ounce bottle of it and that would be fine if it was great but I hate it! I usually love dark beer. Even in the summer I'm ordering whatever porter or stout is at the bar. This one is all wrong. It claims to be vanilla coconut. I dont taste either. It just taste like any other dark beer but with an awful hard to swallow bitterness. I'm so annoyed with this beer right now. If it hadn't cost $10 and if it was 13% alcohol (something I didn't realize until after I bought it) I'd have thrown it out already.,2.31

2901,Pirate Paradise,"Batch 1 that Ive been holding onto for a while. First thing I noticed was the strong vanilla aroma. Very strong, in a very good way. Has a fudgy,vanilla, taste w a strong after taste of toasted coconut. And has ABV hidden well. Overall right on par w bourbon paradise. Prairie might be making the best stouts right now .. Alongside w Toppling Goliath. Damn do I wish I could get this often.",4.99

2903,Pirate Paradise,"Two of my friends recently put together a share to help me out after my bottles were stolen at Dark Lord Day. I told them it really wasn't necessary, but that seems to have even motivated them more! So we ended up drinking several top 250 beers, which is always exciting for me - I was stunned that they managed to grab a Pirate Paradise though. I'm a very big fan of Bourbon Paradise, and a huge lover of Prairie beers in general - this was certainly a wish list item!",4.58

F: smooth, thick, just barely carbonated, awesome drinking",4.93
2905,Pirate Paradise,"12oz bottle, served in a stemmed glass. Pours a thick, oily dark black body, one finger white head, short retention, not much in way of lacing. Smell is sweet rum, vanilla, sugarcane, milk chocolate, a bit of sweet coconut, cocoa. It's mildly boozy, but rum is more or less always that way. Flavour is chewy milk chocolate, cocoa, a bit of sweet and oily coconut, more milk chocolate, a smooth and extended run of rum throughout, with a smooth, mild vanilla sweetness lingering on the backend. Mainly it's vanilla and rum mingling together on the backend, which is rounded out by a slight cocoa-like bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied, substantial, lower but still appropriate carbonation, mildly boozy rum on the finish. A very good barrel-aged adjunct stout that isn't quite pastry stout level but it's an excellent stout in its own right. Probably one of the few rum barrel-aged stouts that I have really enjoyed. I do agree that this one is a step up above Bourbon Paradise as the rum seems to work better with the adjuncts than the bourbon.",4.49

Aroma of roast malts, bourbon whiskey, oak, chocolate and vanilla, a hint of fusel alcohols. Very moderate carbonation, but not lifeless. Rich and warming mouthfeel. The flavour has the same elements as the aroma, but is not too sweet. A very good beer, but personally I prefer the ""ordinary"" Speedway Stout.",4.09

Midnight black with a mushroom cap, textures reveal themselves in certain lightings. Chocolate brownies, bourbon, wood, vanilla, coffee, soil, molasses, and malts o plenty in the nose. Tastes as it smells, caramel makes a strong appearance, dark fruits and coconut in a lesser way, but less coffee and earth. Feel is malty, lush, warm, thick, yet sweeter.

The smell is potent, even from a 4 oz. taster glass, and shows off the barrel aging and oak nicely. The flavor is also exceptionally smooth, strong and potent, with a solid hit of alcohol, and a good bourbon taste. Solid, meaty and strong, it's a triple threat, and definitely worth of following the other Speedway styles.",4.21
2921,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I'm a huge fan of Fremont's Barrel Aging Program, and even as Goose Island sold out, Bourbon County remains a brew to benchmark against. It is rare to meet a BA Stout of this caliber and this is exactly what we have with the BBA Speedway. It's good - better than BCBS on their off years. Maybe better than their best.",4.59
2922,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,On tap at the brewery. Opaque dark chocolate color with a thin tan head. A nice barrel aroma along with some chocolate and coffee. The taste was as expected.

Coffee, dark chocolate and roasty notes are also apparent. The woodiness of the oak really comes through on the taste and adds a lot of earthiness to the beer. Taste is not as coffee heavy as the smell. Feel is more like a porter in that it's a little light for a stout. Minimal carbonation and smooth drinking.",4.42
2935,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Black color with dark brown head. Aroma has slightly acidic coffee, even a bit green with some bourbon in the background. Taste is sweet at first, fudgy, continues with sweetened coffee and bourbon, a hint of green coffee bitterness on the finish. Full bodied, medium carbonation. Really nice variation of the base beer, adds a nice flavor complexity.",4.5
2936,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Dark cola brown in the glass with bits of light coming through the edges. No head lingers in the glass but there was lovely carbonation at first. Barrel and coffee comes through in the most but the barrel is not super pronounced. Roast, slight chocolate and vanilla and booze is there but well balanced and dare I say hidden. Taste is somewhat sweet with a roasty middle and followed by a woodsy back end with the slightest bourbon bite. Feel is kind of thin especially for the style. It has slightly more carbonation than is usual for the style but barely any objectively speaking. Overall a great beer that is very well balanced but could use some more body.

Strong maple syrup nose; faint whiff of smoke. Flavors of maple, coffee, sweet toffee and caramel candy base; lite roast, char. Full body, slick feel; very little warmth for 9.5%; moderate minus carbonation. Overall the maple has held up well; I could smell the maple wafting from the glass at least a foot plus away; not too adjuncty; the bacon is more a liquid smoke taste, but the dominant taste and aroma is Mrs. Butterworth’s. Funky Buddha excels at flavored pastry stouts, and this beer is one of its best.",4.58
2943,Wide Awake It's Morning,"Pours black with a half inch khaki head that leaves very little lacing. Smells is very maple syrup forward with bacon, coffee and toast coming in the background.

Full bodied especially for a porter, lightly carbonated, thick and creamy mouth feel, mildly bitter finish.",4.46
2944,Wide Awake It's Morning,"Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam that retains really well. Aroma is heavy maple syrup and coffee with robust notes of roasty, toasty, bready malts and spry vanilla beans just beyond. It smells like a fresh slice of toast, dressed and drenched by maple syrup, while a roasty, steaming cup of coffee sits just aside. Flavor profile is dense and rich, hitting notes of roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts, and rich, boisterious notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla bean and maple syrup. It smell and drinks sweet, but not to a point of being cloying, or sickly. Mouth feel is velvety and creamy, with a thick consistency. Overall, a thick and sugary beer, that while it lands more in the dessert beer category, does present itself exceptionally well as balanced and filling.",4.5
2945,Wide Awake It's Morning,"Black in color with no light penetration. There’s a fingernail of brown covering nearly all of the top. Light lacing. The aroma is of coffee, maple syrup, and bacon fat.

2953,Wide Awake It's Morning,"Blind review. Sent in NBS BIF#8 from roguer. Poured into tulip. Bottled 4/19/18
Pours jet black, rocky mocha head of just about an inch.
Nose is maple cookies (my stepmom makes these maple cookies, they don’t taste good but they smell amazing), vanilla, hazelnut? Or nuts in general?
Upon first sip, maple for sure, like a lot of maple, maybe more maple, sweetness, strawberry (could be from sweetness) vanilla, lactose sweetness, smoke, pancakes (malts) mild roast, mild coffee. Me trying to breakdown the maple syrup-caramel and/or brown sugar.
As it warms, strawberry and nuttiness disappears, smoke and slight char become more present.
The body is medium but smooth with a lingering maple sweetness at the finish.
From the pour, I let this warm up for 45 minutes or so. I’ve decided that it’s some sort of adjunct (maple bomb) imperial stout/porter from Funky Buddha.",4.46
2954,Wide Awake It's Morning,"03/2015 - so much maple syrup on the nose, plus coffee and bready aromas; incredible iced coffee-like flavors, lovely maple syrup yet not sickly sweet, some lactose, and a bit of salt on the palate; roasty bitterness finishes it off.",4.39

Look: Black with tan head/lacing
Smell: Big nose - sweet maple syrup, smoky malts, bacon, coffee

Overall: Excellent. Recommended.",4.56
2956,Wide Awake It's Morning,"this thing is a beast, even more packed with all of these awesome flavors than the maple bacon is, but without the unifying and mellowing barrel elements of the morning wood. big thanks to my homie for bringing this one over for maple beer night, i had not ever seen it before, but have loved its two sister beers! its as thick and dense looking as it seems like it should be, near black but a high luster and some nice thick foamy tan head. it smells more like coffee than anything else, seemingly higher in the proportionality than in the maple bacon, a little less smoke and greasiness and all too, and still with a high maple sweetness element. there is a lot of nuance here too though like black pepper and fresh tobacco and molasses. its as complex in the flavor too, but we are all sort of stunned at how this isnt super insanely sweet. i mean its still way more sugary than you could reasonably drink a whole bomber of, but this is not over the top at all, despite the maple flavor still being really potent in here. nice almost burnt dark malt complexion to even it out, and all the coffee really helps. i didnt catch a bottle date, but the coffee tastes pretty fresh in here to me, and its intensity cuts some of the weight of the body and the sweetness, i like its contribution a lot. the bacon part of this is a little underwhelming, less obvious in the mix than in the base beer, light campfire smoke is all, this isnt meaty or anything to me. a really intense brew, but as good as any of the wildly flavored stouts these guys do. i dont think it needs the barrel. i enjoyed this edition a lot and it was a great end to our epic maple beer night!",4.31
2957,Wide Awake It's Morning,22 ounce bottle into a snifter. Had 11/4/17.,4.27
2958,Wide Awake It's Morning,So much coffee!! But doesn't taste like burn coffee grounds. Like a well balanced DDH....this is the same with coffee aromas and flavors. On the nose is like waking up at your favorite roastery.....but taste is mellow and warming like your own personal barista caring for this cold brew. FB is a top brewery for a reason,4.56
2959,Wide Awake It's Morning,"This is pretty much Maple Bacon Coffee Porter. It is extremely sweet as the original but it is better balanced by the higher booze. Pours thick and creamy, crazy to think it's a porter.",4.91
2960,Wide Awake It's Morning,22oz bottle poured into a snifter. Not sure the bottle date.,4.52
2961,Wide Awake It's Morning,"Mostly maple with some coffee. Has a metallic flavor to it. Reminds of waffle crisp cereal, you know, it’s not too bad but leaves an after taste that seems really fake maple. Did not enjoy this very much, prefer Hipster Brunch by quite a bit for a beer with these adjuncts. Finished half the bottle and then went on to something else.",3.26
2962,Wide Awake It's Morning,It's been awhile since I experienced MBCP so was really excited to try this one. It does not disappoint.,4.45
2963,Wide Awake It's Morning,"Poured into a 16 oz Snulip glass, not sure when it was bottled and 9.2% ABV. Pours a very attractive slick black with a 2 plus finger dark tan head that leaves thin wisps of lace at near room temperature.",4.37
2964,Wide Awake It's Morning,Looks exceptionally creamy.,4.04
2965,Cable Car Kriek,Look of murky ruby red. Small amount of head forms at the top. Smell is of vinous cherry. Smells excellent still. Taste is light acidity and funk with full blown cherry. The feel is light and perfect amount of carbonation. Even after all these years it still has a lot of cherry. Hands down one of the best sours I have ever had the opportunity to drink. Would hunt it down again for sure.,4.77
2966,Cable Car Kriek,"Had this side by side with 2013 regular Cable Car and Veritas 012.
A: Be warned, this is a gusher! We were aware of it so we opened it carefully enough to lose very few of it. Pours darker than Veritas 012, reddish with a good white foam.
S: Smell is really complex, although the cherry is not obvious. The balance is awesome. Barnyard, funk, verry clean. Tart cherries come after with raspberries and minerals aromas. Reminiscent of the old 3F Hommage for some reason.
T: Taste is more focused on the red fruits and some soaked fruits. Still very clean for an American wild ale. Lots of funk, barnyard, horse blanket, hay. Sharp sourness, no acidic acid, no lactiness. Highly drinkable.
M: Well carbonated, soft mouthfeel, puckering sourness, awesome!
O: Mindblowing beer. Very very surprising. It brings Cable Car to another level and completely overwhelms the Veritas 012. I am glad I was able to try this, it certainly lives up to the hype.",4.86

Lacks funk of traditional lambic but not bad.",4
2975,Cable Car Kriek,"SO EXCITED to try this beer. I walked into SD Toronado (the SUPERIOR Toronado of the two) while I was on my birthday vacation and was shocked to see this sitting in the cooler. Yes, it was SITTING IN THE COOLER...for all to see. No asking the bartenders if they have it just to let them decide if they like you enough to serve it to you. This Toronado does it how it should be. Such great service, outstanding food, and great beer selection. Back to the Kriek,..it poured a lot less ""pink"" than I thought it would be. It was a clouded, light-red color with an off-white head. Scent is very cherry-forward with some definite barnyard and musty aromas. The smell is so darn inviting, I can't help but take few sips of this beer immediately. The cherry is so profound in this beer, more than I expected. A good amount of oak and funk. Not overly acidic whatsoever...in fact, not very acidic at all. Just a clean, funky, fruity, wild ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, almost puckering, with a juicy finish. Sour and juicy equals amazing in my book. Drinkability is VERY HIGH. Overall, this beer was worth every penny I spent on it. I went into the night willing to spend $80 on the bottle, just to find out it was $55. So worth it. A phenomenal wild ale.",4.67
2976,Cable Car Kriek,"On tap at the Toronado anniversary party. Pours a reddish murky amber with no head and no lacing left on the glass. The aroma is big cherry.

2991,Grey Monday,"Pours a very dark brown, or more so, it's black with brown shining through the edges. Its a blood-burgundy color with a clear transparency when direct sunlight pierces it. Head is a finger of khaki-caramel foam after a slow pour, but it fizzles out quickly. Aroma is raisins, toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate and roasty, toasty, earthy, nutty and caramely malts. Heat is seeping through pretty heavy with a whollop of bourbon booze at the back. Flavor profile is raisins, figs, toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate, molasses and syrup with hearty roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely and bready malts. It's thick, thick and thick. Drinking a boozy cookie. Bourbon adds heat that seems in and lingers long after the malts wash away. A touch of char adds a little grounding bitterness for the sugary initiation. Mouth feel is thick, sticky, velvety and chewy. Overall, thick and boozy with a lot of complexities. It's super rich and full, which is what you'd imagine out of an 20% ABV beer.",4.45
2992,Grey Monday,"Received from @2beerdogs in NBS BIF 10 – Thanks Derek! Reviewed 1/26/20.
“2018 Edition”. Etched on the shoulder above the rear label “B#573 6/25/18” above “11:19 005479”. Stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 55 degrees (as stated on the label) in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 62 degrees F.
Appearance – 3.
First pour – Medium brown, clear.
Body – Dark brown/black, opaque. When held to direct light, a very deep red-amber, translucent. No legs.
Head – Large (Maximum four cm, aggressive center pour), tannish with large bubbles nosily popping, gone within a minute after the pour is completed, leaving thin partial ring of tiny bubbles, fed by effervescence. While not fizzy, the head demonstrates no tendency to last. At 18.9% ABV, this is not surprising.
Lacing – None, again 18.9% ABV.
Aroma – 4 - Has an almost watery raisin aroma with some weak wood and possibly bourbon in the background.
Flavor – 4 – The flavor is somewhat elusive, starting slightly sweet and a bit fruity, without bourbon, oak, or hazelnut. The nasal raisins seem to be dominant. No alcohol (18.9% ABV as marked on label) aroma or flavor, but massive numbing of the tongue and soft palate as it warms while being held in the mouth. Alcohol on the exhale. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide, no hops.
Palate – 4 – Medium, just short of syrupy, lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4. The appearance in unremarkable, looking like any headless imperial stout. The aroma is most like Flying Dog’s Raison D’Etre, at least to my burnt-out lab nose. In the flavor I find no hint of hazelnuts, oak, or bourbon, just a generic sweetness with a hint of DARK FRUIT, something I didn’t taste (other than raisins) until I was typing this summary. Palate feels good, but I’ve corked the bottle after one glass, so I don’t wake up with my head on the keyboard and beer leaking onto the motherboard (Incidentally, Mrs. Lizard has miraculously appeared and approved the corking of the bottle for later. Maybe today I won’t sleep through Noir Alley!) Overall, I’ve probably rated this too high, but it’s from The Bruery, so, by definition, it HAS to be a superior brew.",3.94

This whole series has had huge dark fruit notes. It just smells like you're going to get drunk. The taste comes in hot with booze and the dark fruit remains.

T - There is classic Black Tuesday sweetness and a little bitter boozy notes. Finish is a little nutty.
F - The mouth feel is a little thin but sticky. Finish is dry and a little astringent. Definitely has chest heat.
O - I don't think this is much better than Black Tuesday. The hazelnuts are a unique variation. But I don't think there is as much depth.",4.63

3014,Grey Monday,"In the interest of fairness, I am not a huge fan of hazelnut. There is something of putting about the overall profile. That said, at the front the thick boozing this is very apparent. Lingering about the mouth, the hazelnut was very easy to detect. The field was very sticky and sweet, swinging easily to the sides of the mouth. The feel was almost chewy. Raisins and dark fruit were also present. Yet in the overall scheme of things, the hazelnut make this hard for me to like.",4.08
3015,Parabajava,"Pours black with a finger of tan-khaki foam. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, and caramely malts with some mild coffee mixed into the nose. Dark chocolate and molasses mingle for a little sweetness and complexity. Flavor profile is heavy stout, with roasty, toasty, caramely, nutty, and bready malts. Coffee comes in just after the start and lingers to the end. Mild coffee notes. Dark chocolate and molasses add a little further sweetness. Some bourbon and alcohol heat on the backend. Mouth feel is thick and heavy with a surprisingly still texture. Overall, heavy stout with some great coffee notes and some boozy heat too. Good blend of each, allowing the base stout to shine through the mix.",4.45

Taste follows the brewer's description quite well. Most excellent mouthfeel; very smooth and viscous.

3030,Parabajava,"this review comes with an asterisk, which is that i must have had a somewhat off experience with this one, in that there is no way the whole world loves this so much and i found it unremarkable. i have wanted to try this for a long long time and was so stoked to finally get the chance, but i suspect a distributor or an account or even the brewery held on to this keg for way too long, knowing they had something special here and wanting to save it for just the right moment. well, to me it tastes like that moment had long passed by the time this one was flowing, the coffee tastes and smells stale, and it has seemingly broken down some of the body that makes this base beer so monumental. what i can appreciate is what its supposed to be, a rich espresso layer over one of the most flavorful and interesting stouts to ever exist, an unnecessary but fancy layer, a little green peppery now, and a little acidic and thinning, but probably absurdly appealing in its prime. the alcohol is somehow really well hidden, maybe one benefit of its apparent age, cant believe its as strong as it is. some nice dark chocolate and char to this, still plenty of barrel on it too, faint vanilla and tobacco as well, lots happening but wonderful integration at the same time. i enjoyed this still a lot, impossible not to, but in this instance certainly not one of the best beers in the world. i know what it can be though, and i cant wait to try it under more idea conditions... until next time!",4.01

Taste is a tremendous combination of red wine oak barrel, the added currant fruit, and the wild nature of the yeast. Notes of tobacco and slight funk. Rather wet and juicy at the end.
Medium mouth feel, slightly tight vinous quality. Good carbonation.
I really enjoyed this beer. Shares a lot of characteristics with a good Cabernet Sauvignon wine, but is more complex with the malts and yeasty funk. Also really hides the higher ABV% well.",4.62
3060,Consecration,"Meager dusting of tan foam which is pretty much gone just as the pour settles, in turn no lacing to speak of but one really wasn’t expecting much of either. Light and fully transparent brownish red with wide yellow rims, while the bubbles are about as miniscule as imaginable there are steady streams of them. The sour cherry scents stunted by caramelized brown sugar and molasses notes, touch of coconut flakes, more vinegary than vinous, turns to pie dough and Ovaltine, not as high-toned as expected nor as generally powerful. Medium-bodied, has acidic punch and feels very firm in the mouth. The cherry, currant fruit flavors strong here but so is the oak. Grilled nuts, cocoa, molasses to at times more American oak dill accents. Clean attack, gets funkier towards the finish and retronasally. No astringency, dryness or deep puckering sensations, balanced and approachable. No alcoholic heat either. Even as one notes this, it bears the stamp of a wild ale, albeit mannered. The grip extends the texture a good bit after the flavors have subsided. Not discerning noticeable change as it warms towards room temperature. Suavely arrayed.",4.06
3061,Consecration,"July 27th, 2015 - Legendary and luxurious, I now get to have the Consecration fresh from the tap. Dark and with soda like bubbles on the edge, it gives off a power and luscious smell of sour cherries and candied apples, bright and beautiful. And the flavor gives much the same, with a perfect, perfect sourness and a perfect acidity. The flavor notes feature juicy bordeaux grapes and even a bit of sparkling grape juice. It's far better than it sounds, and absolutely lands the acidity.",4.51
3062,Consecration,Pours a fairly clear dark red color with a thin foamy head that quickly dissipates. Very little to no lacing. Aroma of sour dark fruits and red wine. Tart and smooth taste. Red wine and dark fruits. Very good.,4.22
3063,Consecration,Bottled 1 year ago.,4.46
3064,Consecration,Terrific beer with amazing Brett. Great dank smell with perfect balance between darkness and sour. Great level of carbonation and an absolute pleasure to drink.,4.67
3065,Framboos,"Shared 750 ml corked & caged bottle at local tasting. Red colour, very little carbonation, no head. Intense aroma of ripe and over-ripe raspberries. Sour and intense flavour, ripe and over-ripe raspberries again, some tart and lemony notes too.",3.93
3066,Framboos,I had the 14 (no carb) but still a wonderful beer to try. Still very delicate and fruity even if the stillness of the beer can be a bit distracting if you're looking for something more effervescent.,4.3
3067,Framboos,"Season 18/19. Blend no. 29. Poured at 54 degrees. Deep gold with excellent clarity; thick, rocky white bubbles; initially poor cap retention, but as the bottle warmed, much better retention and moderately heavy lacing. Earthy raspberry aroma, with light barnyard funk; some aged cheese; fresh baled hay. Taste is raspberry, sour fruit, tart green apples and some funky hay. Light carbonation; light body, but not watery; dry, light acidic feel; minor pucker. Overall very pleasant to drink but no “wow” factors; fairly mild sour raspberry nose/taste; funk factor is low; minor ding to aroma score for cheesy notes; very good, but expensive...I’d drink again if at a lower price point.",4.41

3071,Framboos,"It’s exactly what I want my fruited lambic to taste like. Rich flavors that don’t overwhelm the base beer or hide the natural funkiness. Drinks clean and easy, not overly tart.",4.91
3072,Framboos,"Pours a weird orange/pink/gold with medium carbonation. Vintage is 2018, picked up from the lambic-o-droom in late 2019 and smuggled back to the USA. Aroma is tart fruit. Taste is much the same with a nice acidity. Fantastic balance between fruit, acidity, complex sour beer. Just a fantastic beer to sip through. Complex and refreshing at the same time with fruit hanging out but not taking center stage.",4.93
3073,Framboos,"Season 17|18 Blend No. 16 - drank on February 17th, 2020. Not quite the fruit-forward framboise that I'd expected, Framboos has quite a lot more oak and sourness than the tart berry that I'm accustomed to. The nose is wonderful, and the barrel plays well with the tartness. Beautiful pour, though not quite so dark as the krieks and framboises I'm more experienced with. Quite good.",4.58
3074,Framboos,"Priciest beer I've bought to date -- ~$50 in Belgium. Sat on this for about a year awaiting the right occasion, and my friend's bachelor party seemed like a great time to bring it out. Simply put, this is a wonderful lambic that is overflowing with raspberry character. The clean funky-tartness of the base lambic complements the intense raspberry nicely and the drinkability is top-notch, as per usual with 3 Fonteinen. Reminded me a lot of Allagash's Coolship Red, which is a more reasonably priced and (relatively) easily available alternative.",4.5
3075,Framboos,"I drank 3 Fonteinen Framboos a raspberry Lambic imported from Belgium, ABV 5.30%, in my backyard. It was truly delicious as well as thirst quenching (hot here), and my wife and my daughter who tasted it as well agrees with me. Lambic connoisseurs will love it and so will everyone else.

Overall, the nose matches the taste as this is sharp and tart with a slight amount of raspberry sweetness to balance it all out. Additionally, there is a slight barnyard funk that you'd expect in a lambic. The mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. Overall, a great example of the style.",4.53

Taste is sour, dry, fruity, astringent with berry pit bitterness on the finish. Medium minus body with medium carbonation. Really fruit forward, tart, easy drinking.",4.6
3082,Framboos,"different label than the one pictured here, the double label, looks nice, lighter pink than expected and lighter in color than hommage, 2018 vintage. short head, nice clarity, and a ton of fruit in the nose. i think the cherry in the hommage adds more than it immediately gets credit for, as this seems in some ways one dimensional, not a critique necessarily, as its really pure and ripe and beautiful raspberry, but there is less complexity there. the fermentation profile is awesome, a little younger lambic base, but its perfect with the fruit, its cool to still be able to taste and appreciate the grain in this, lots of oak, rose wine and flowers, lemons and minerals, i think it tastes slightly less dramatic than it smells. a little sulfur and then the fruit, red wine, and lots of oak, mature but cleaner than some of their others i have had, maybe because its so new, but its tidy and fast to finish, even with all the raspberries. their base lambic always stands out to me as one of the best, and the fruit really works well here. id like to try this a little more bottle aged, but i sure did enjoy this one. nice with chocolate and cakey dessert...",4.31

The flavor was alright, it was slightly sour, raspberries but honestly I was expecting to be blown away and I wasn't. This was a good framboise but I preferred Hommage.",3.96
3089,Framboos,"Poured at pretty close to fridge temp. Look is ruby red with slight transparency. Nose is deep and complex. Raspberries, sweet candy. Taste is WOW. So fruit forward.

Smells of sweet medium light bodied malts and a hint of some citrusy/grapefruit and floral hops at the end.

3094,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Pours a murky, opaque pale orange with two fingers of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is papaya, orange, mango, and some resiny, herbal hop behind. The latter comes with a little hop bite and burn, but otherwise smooth. Flavor profile is orange, mango, and papaya with herbal, medicinal, resiny hops for bitterness. Initially, lightly sweet, but quickly turns to a hop burn that comes with some muddled and mashed flavors. Mouth feel is a touch harsh on the effervescence initially and then fades to a more bubbly, chalky texture. Overall, some great qualities, but the mashing of resiny, burning hops with citrus doesn't come together well. Couple that with the bite in the texture and this is not an easy sipper.",4.11

3097,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,I tried this beer at the brewery. It poured a hazy yellow with white head and that left some lace. The scent had tropical fruit peel notes.

3109,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"People are raving about this one apparently, but I’d counter a bit as I’d put this third behind regular Pseudo Sue and the Galaxy version which is my favorite due to a strong affinity for galaxy hops.

3110,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Full bodied and hoppy enough that it could pass as a west coast IPA, though cleaner. So clean. Citrus notes up front. A hint of tropical notes pair with sharp lemon, lime, and grapefruit/grapefruit peel. A streak of piney, resinous, herbal, hoppy bitterness characterizes the lengthy and balanced finish. The whole experience is very smooth, somehow dry yet juicy, and incredibly crisp and clean. One of the better pale ales I've ever had.",4.51
3111,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Delicious world class pale ale. It really seems to have changed over the years, but it's still a fantastic citra bomb. Great pillowy mouthfeel, not too bitter, and a lot of citrus.",4.78
3112,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Much more aggressively bitter than normal Pseudo Sue. This one steps over into the west coast IPA territory! Piney flavor like galangal.

3113,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Had a hazy orange appearance with a pineapple aroma. Fruit forward taste, predominately grapefruit and orange. Finishes a little dry.

3114,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"This is a strange one for the Raul man. Like, it’s a bit enigmatic like eating mushrooms with David Lynch. It pours a beautiful haze like Jimmy Hendrix shredding on his ax, and it has a very pleasant aroma too. Taste is good upfront, but then it kind of slaps me on the ass like my baby mama does to me when I come home too late from da club.

3132,Great,"On tap at NC Rare 1/28/17. Caramel color. Smell was caramel, dark fruit, malts. Tasted more like an English barleywine. No hops at all. Mostly caramel, dates, raisin, mild barrel. Overall, this was a fantastic beer. The barrel was not overdone like a lot of BA barleywines.",4.6
3133,Great,"Big, thick, and dark (there's a joke in there somewhere) are the only ways to describe this epic barleywine from Alpine! While overall I found it to be a touch too sweet, it's still a fantastic BA version of the style.",4.42

Standard tropical hop tastes. Some citrus and wine notes in there. Some dankness for good measure.
Good mouthfeel, but there’s a significant hop burn going down. I think they went too far with the dry-hopping. Instead of bitter taste they accentuated the throat burning effect.

3190,Gggreennn!,"Thanks @Roguer
Hazy, for sure. Nice fluffy head, great retention.
The nose bursts with guava, followed by orange zest, melon, mango, pineapple and, well, green notes.
The flavor jumps off with the citrus first. Zesty orange, creamy tangerine, mango, slightly sweet gritty grain note (in a great way), and a fine line between juicy and a gentle bitterness. But overall, a very smooth ride allowing for all of these flavors to take a turn in the limelight.
The mouthfeel is fluffy, medium weight, with a good carbonation level. A smooth bitterness closes it down.

There is some soft baked bread and oat notes that come through as well. The palate brings the resin pine hop notes forward to meet up with the fruits. the tropical fruits more prominent than the stone on the flavor profile particularly some grilled pineapple. The ale finishes beautifully with a richness on the mouth and a good bite of bitterness. Revisited this Oct ‘21 and appreciated it even more.,4.56

3242,Bomb!,I can smell the cocoa and coffee but besides that I'm just getting sweet malts.,4.8
3243,Bomb!,"Bought on a recommendation at Blackbeard's Crafts on Sawtelle, this one surprised me. Everything in it is subservient to the cacao-- the vanilla stands in for sugar, the coffee offers bitterness where the malty stout would itself refuse to. It does really remind you of a milkshake, but not quite because of any desserty cloying sweetness. It's the viscosity, the half-and-half mouthfeel that delivers the vanilla and cacao while somehow sneaking in a full 12 or 13 percent ABV when you can barely even register the burn. Mine poured into a snifter with no head and barely even the sound of fizziness, and on the nose it's pure dessert-- chocolate milk or devil's food cake. I try not to inhale too much as I drink it, because I want to catch the ancho chili and the beer in a way that the aroma doesn't carry. Usually, this is not my kind of thing-- I don't like foreign flavors as a dominant element, and I like for a fine food to carry more layers, or maybe more variance between its layers. ""Bomb!"", instead, wields its complexity in a way that focuses your attention onto that single 65-percent-cacao sensory simulacrum, making you wonder how this is even beer.",4.22

3245,Bomb!,"There's good carbonation, despite absolutely no head in the clear pint glass after this was emptied from a twelve ounce brown bottle. A hot peppery smell dominates and behind it, some roasted malt and chocolate. The color of this brew is the common black coffee and without any head, nor lacing, this looks like it could be a black coffee soda. But the taste is so much more complex and interesting. First, this is incredibly smooth for a laceless stout. It has a very good body, rich and velvety across the tongue. There's much to taste, mostly chocolate, somehow neither sweet, nor bitter, a hint of vanilla and just a little peppery heat. It's definitely not a burn, just a little heat. Actually, there's more pepper to the nose than to the taste. But that's OK. Why argue with a near perfect balance. Absolutely no clue that this rings in with an astonishing 13% ABV. This might not be the best brew you've ever had, but it is certainly one you must try, should the chance arise.",4.53

Mouthfeel is on the lighter side but carries great depth of flavor with no reliance on barrel aging.
A very well made beer and I was very impressed by the sublety of the chili. Too much coffee for my taste that left an unpleasant bitterness on the finish. Interesting but not one I would rush to seek out. Will leave the other one in the cellar a few months and see if it improves.",4.19

The flavor profile is perfectly balanced with no off-tasting notes. Cocoa nibs dance around with coffee and vanilla. Mild ancho chili spice rounds out the taste, keeping this interesting and preventing it from becoming cloying. This is on the sweeter side, and while there is a hint of roasted chocolate malt, it isn’t dry or smoky like some stouts. Highly potent at 13% abv, but the alcohol is masked.

O: Good beer, although I’d classify it as a NEIPA.",4
3266,Pseudo Sue,"Looks, smells, and tastes like passionfruit juice. Unbelievable amount of tropical fruit juice flavors and a very (and I mean very) subtle bitterness. This is a substantial yet crushable pale ale. Pretty close to perfection. 4.5/5",4.5
3267,Pseudo Sue,Pours a very cloudy golden color with a thick foamy head. Head retention is good. Lacing is very good. Juicy orange citrus aroma.

3271,Pseudo Sue,"Looking at this impenetrable haze of murky yellow-peach colored concoction isn’t pretty, but the billowing white foam and lacing portends exceptional craftsmanship. One smell, and the pungent aroma of grapefruit, orange, mango, and pineapple confirms exquisite quality. Great tasting, but a bit boring. Should be on an index card for the absolute standard in easy drinking, hazy pale ales. Flavors of orange and grapefruit and mango burst through. Bitter without being too bitter, a tinge of grassy earthiness without being too floral, everything is in balance and in moderation. Velvety smooth, light mouthfeel with good carbonation.",4.29

Appearance: Pours a pale straw-colored yellow reminiscent of watered-down orange juice color with about a finger of foam.

3273,Pseudo Sue,"Appearance is a hazy pale orange like a fresh squeezed orange juice. Aroma is definitely grapefruit, pineapple, and mango as well as fresh squeezed orange juice.

3279,Pseudo Sue,"Pseudo Sue pours a cloudy/milky looking orange/pineapple/mango juice color with nice head and a fragrant nose of citrus fruit. Pineapple, orange and mango. add those fruity juices together and some pine cones. There's your perfect juice bomb for hop heads. This is after a King Sue.

3282,Pseudo Sue,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a super hazy yellow color with a one finger head of pure white puffy foam. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a decent amount of foamy lacing on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is massive of a yeasty and bready smell mixed with strong aromas of harvest fruits as well lots of mango and orange. Along with these smells comes a rather decent hit of hops, with aromas of herbal and citrus being the most prevalent, but being accompanied by some smells of earth and a floral hop as well. Rounding it all out is a touch of wheat and hay, making a rather nice aroma overall.
Taste – The taste begins with a flavor of a bready and light cracker malt taste that is matched by some citrus sweetness as well as a tiny bit of harvest fruit and a touch of lemon. At the same time there is a showing of hop, with a herbal and citrus hop being strongest upfront. As the taste advances the sweet citrus seems to grow slightly stronger and is joined by some mango and papaya. The hop also changes over time, initially being mainly of an herbal and citrus nature, but over time taking on some light floral notes as well as a bit of pine. With the flavor transitions that occur throughout, one is left with a rather pleasant and moderately bready taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is rather average to slightly lower. Overall, the feel was pretty good for the very hazy, and moderately malty, nature of the brew and made for a rather easy drinker.
Overall – A rather tasty and very hazy pale ale. A good, easy drinking brew overall.",4.21
3283,Pseudo Sue,"Pour is a murky bright yellow with a finger and half of chalk white foam. Great retention and lacing.
Nose is grapefruit, citrus, pine
Taste is pine, resin, grapefruit rind, citrus. Enough bitterness to not be overly sweet. Finishes with a lightly sweet bready malt character.",4.43
3284,Pseudo Sue,"To my surprise I just found this in TX. Had heard loads about it, so here we are with their pale ale.
Super hazy, orangish body.
Nose is an extremely inviting citrus bouquet of grapefruit and stone fruit, with some floral notes. Wow let’s dig in.
Taste is packed with flavors of mango, grapefruit and overall juiciness….bitternes is there to for sure, while some pine notes round it all out. Definitely goes down way fast.
Feels smooth and medium, creamy goodness.
This to me is like a hazy ipa, many of which I tried to where they all seemed similarly, except this as if one was done perfectly. I did expect I lighter beer given its a pale ale around 5-6% abv,. but wow in the flavor. A superb value.",4.59
3285,Pseudo Sue,"Honey/orange, with a foamy white head, and an aroma of oranges, mangos, and pineapple. The taste follows, and adds to, the aroma with bitter orange, mango, grapefruit, pineapple, honey, and pine needles and an almost sweet grapefruit zest/pine resin finish.
APA/IPA aren't my usual beers of choice, but when I have one it might as well be one of the best there is.",4.36
3286,Pseudo Sue,"Wasn’t expecting the haze but after I got past that everything about this beer was solid.
Poured an opaque raw honey color and aroma announced Citra hops in spades.
The taste was far more balanced than the aroma would suggest and I found myself truly enjoying this beer.
The feel was good, really good. Crisp and smooth.
Definitely something I plan on drinking regularly now that it’s sold here.",4.74
3287,Pseudo Sue,16 oz. can - 18 Days Fresh,4.26
3288,Pseudo Sue,"I mean, damn near perfect. Pours a nice medium orange, good head and carbonation. The aroma wafts of tropical fruits and herbal hops. The flavor / taste is probably the most complex of all the Pale Ale’s I’ve tried: a panoply of tropical and citrus flavors, herbal, sneaky hoppy, perfect balance. I don’t know whether I like this or Zombie better because they are sorta different animals but god this is great, cheers!",4.64
3289,Pseudo Sue,"Pours a beautiful hazy orange with a huge creamy head.
All citrus in the aroma.

A: Pours an orange gold color with a half inch of white foam that dissipates fairly quickly. Minimal haze and semi-transparent
S: Smells bitter with pine, resin and grapefruit as well as some orange rind, citrus, and apricot. Malts smell of caramel and biscuit and there is a bit of the dank cannabis smell.
T: Wow! Hoppy bitterness on the front end, but has body and malt character to balance out the hops. Taste is similar to the nose with pine, resin, grapefruit, orange, and apricot but the citrus is more pronounced. The dank cannabis taste gets more pronounced as the beer warms and begins to dominate the after-taste and over come the floral after-taste. The biscuity malt also become more pronounced as the beer warms
F: Smooth, abv is well hidden with right balance of carbonation. Leaves your mouth a bit dry but makes you want to reach for the glass again. Very balanced and leaves your mouth feeling refreshed.
O: Another great Surly beer! Extremely well balanced and has all the qualities you want in an IPA. Definitely would buy again",4.55

3297,Abrasive Ale,"Poured into a glass suited for beer, one-half inch of foam which recedes quickly. The beer is not clear but not hazy. Smell is of orange, light pie crust and something dank. Wonderful feel in the mouth. Carbonation is very good and it is soft on the tongue and palate. I taste oranges. And there is a dankness and resiny undertone that is pleasant, ABV is hidden well.",4.65
3298,Abrasive Ale,"16 oz can from the Wall of Beer in Clemson SC ($4.89) with a November 2020 canning date stamped on the bottom.
Pours with a slightly hazy amber colored body with a good white head.
This is a very good DIPA but some 12+ years after it's introduction it is clearly overrated and over priced . For example, I had an IPA yesterday that was about a good and cost less than half a much. This ale does have an excellent, smooth mouthfeel with well hidden ABV.",3.99
3299,Abrasive Ale,"Pours a medium coppery amber with a big, three finger whitehead with good retention and thick lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops with a little dankness, orange, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Flavor is caramel malt, citrus, piney and dank hops, grapefruit, orange, pine needles, mixed tropical fruit. Citrus rind and fresh pine finish with a deep hop bitterness that is more assertive than abrasive. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I think I would have loved this even years ago, but it is even more welcome now with all the mild, soft hopped hazy ales that are so popular now. This is what I want in an IPA: great herbal hop flavors melded to aggressive alpha oil character. And this delivers. The strong ABV brings out the flavors to a fine degree. This is close in profile to a triple IPA / American barleywine depth. The combo of pine, citrus and dankness is great. It even looks like it will pack a flavor punch. This is a legend for good reason. Although we have fine IPAs in this area, I'd buy this regularly if it was available on the market here.",4.5
3300,Abrasive Ale,"16oz can from Brewers Haven. I didn't get the chance to hit Surly when I was in MN, so I'm glad we're finally seeing distro here. This one of the beers that put them on the map, and it's a throwback to the old days of in your face hoppiness. Dark golden pour with a lasting soft, foamy head. You can detect a hint of caramel malts in the aroma before the hops take over. Taste begins and ends with the hop bitterness, woody, piney, sharp. This what DIPAs used to taste like. Thanks for the memories.",4.18
3301,Abrasive Ale,"Clear dark amber in the St. Bernardus globe with plenty of foam. Some sweetness followed by an attack on the tongue and other sensory organs. Burnt mango, grapefruit pith, It's got everything, including onions and cat pee. It's weird how this is all high notes, as in shrilling piccolo. I even think of the smell of a dry sauna with the wood and sweat. Hot, intense, acidic. It's all peel, no fruit.",3.14

3308,Abrasive Ale,"I used to LOVE this beer. 2020's release is not the same. Flabby, boring, no hoppy bite, malty finish. VERY disappointing. Only good for getting an expensive buzz.",2.95
3309,Abrasive Ale,Pours a golden straw color with almost a finger of head. The nose has some tropical fruit notes but it is much more muted than I expected based on this beer's reputation. The flavor profile has a solid malt backbone with definite notes of tropical fruits mixed in. The finish is a fine bland of hop bitterness and residual sweetness.,4.27

3313,Abrasive Ale,"What a beer. I’ll say it again. WHAT A BEER. Gosh I feel like I waited years to finally get my hands on this and it does not disappoint at all, not one bit. This is one of maybe 5 beers I’ve had in my life that I would say not only live up to, but exceed the hype. I don’t even need to say anything besides this. It is a PERFECT example of an old school ipa. Not west coast, not a juice bomb. Candied stone fruits galore. No booziness at all for the abv. Scary drinkable. I’m gonna have another even though I probably shouldn’t at 9%. It’s well worth the cost of admission.",4.68
3314,Abrasive Ale,Bitterness and sweet hoppy citrus all wrapped up in this intense hop bomb. Rarely do you find this amount of bitterness balanced out with the oatmeal malt characteristics yet still drinks like one of the most impressive IPA’s. Bitter lovers enjoy!,4.58

3317,Permanent Funeral,"2020-12-06 Crowler poured yesterday at Sam the Beer Man.
I'm so thankful that 3F has been able to expand their distribution. I've been planning a return trip for a while...and then there was 2020. This too shall pass.
Look...is every bit a ""5"". Translucent...on the brink of clarity; very important that i don't mistake this from a beverage that i couldn't consider if i was vegan. Pours a shaded peachy golden color with better a two finger lite tan loose collar that resists fading, This guy enjoys optimum effervescence and leaves a fair amount of lacing.
Smell...I like to judge this by a couple of factors; the aggressiveness of the experience and the component characteristics. I almost docked this. It hit me immediately but it was from less than 'arms reach', ha! When i held this up, it was like being back at the brewpub. This, to me, defines the aroma of a CLASSIC 'Imperial IPA'.Perfectly balanced tangy orange and vanilla maltiness with those grassy hop notes.
TASTE/FEEL/OVERALL... this is the THING! You almost can't judge these separately. It's bright and out-of -the-box creamy. Sweet and hoppy. It's 'Imperial' but it doesn't kick you in the face. The flavor finishes with piney grassy notes that linger on-and-on. Very appropriate (old's cool).
It pretty much doesn't get much better than this!!
My hat is off to Three Floyds and Sam the Beer Man. Happy Holidays my friends.",5

3324,Permanent Funeral,"Imperial Pale Ale does not mean IPA by default and this is a great example of how. Possibly worst beer name ever btw.
Gorgeous beer - Deep, deep amber-orange with an everlasting clotted cream head that left speckled sheets of white lace trail.
Aroma is not pungent to my nose but very balanced and inviting beer smells waft off as I swirl the chalice - raw, wet grain, pine needles and straw with alcohol notes ever in the background.
More balanced flavors of rich, caramel malt countered by wood n leather hop surrounded by fruit hints of melon and pear.
There is no middle here - sweet and fruity up front and firm, nearly harsh bitter bite on the back end.
Body is full but just barely as this invites big swallows that do not feel heavy or cloying - but encourage another.
Long, smoldering dry hop and alcohol finish.
Despite the ever present alcohol, this is highly drinkable and flavorful, it's booziness just part of it's charm.",4.39

3328,Permanent Funeral,Pours a somewhat hazy golden orange with a white head that dissipates rather quickly. It has a slightly piney smell with notes of mango and pineapple apparent. There are also hints of guava and a floral hoppy finish. The taste is dominated but the pineapple mango taste with a hoppy floral finish to keep it from being too bitter. It goes down incredibly easily for almost 11% alcohol. Overall a stand out beer.,4.34

Sweet, but not oppressively. Slow to drink, but it's not prohibitive. Lactose, as always, ruins it. Although without the lactose I'd probably still be complaining about how sharp and sweet it was.

Smell is sweet and maple.
Don't get a whole lot of roast or coffee.
Flavor follows with the sweetness. After it warms up I feel like it became a bit more bitter and bakers chocolaty Definitely more dynamic.
I think this is a pretty good beer but not worth any of the hype around a 100 score on BA. I'd much rather drink their IPAs",3.78
3356,Moment Of Clarity,"16oz can, served in a Tree House snifter glass. Pours a dark opaque black body, one finger mocha head, good retention, a bit of lacing. Smell is milk chocolate, thick roast, sweet maple. It's sweet. Not much coffee behind it, but it has a bit of dusky chocolate, like baking chocolate or something similar to that. It's fairly fudgy but not roasty or bitter. Flavour brongs up front maple, milk chocolate, a bit of roast, and more chocolate. It's smooth up front, but has a bit more baker's chocolate, a mild earthy bitterness on the backend. It's very tasty and melds well with the added adjuncts. Full bodied, smooth, creamy and even a bit nutty on the backend. An overall excellent adjunct stout. There is just enough maple and chocolate to satisfy my mildly sweet tooth without being cloying or overwhelmingly sugary. It's delicious and almost ice-cream like.",4.44

Cinnamon, coconut, very dark chocolate, bourbon, black licorice, burnt toffee, blackberries, and honey. I'm not getting much coffee on the nose. The nose, to me, is not overly complex. That said, I don't think it needs to be. The taste is really nice. Tons of cinnamon and coconut - probably the most dominant flavors. The bourbon is there, but not really dominant. The cinnamon is very strong. It tastes as described. The coffee is there, but I don't get a heavy hit of it. the mouthfeel is crazy - this, to me, is where this beer really stands out.

Alcohol is cloyed, but whoa, this could be served between two! Border pastry stout? mmm...I would have desired a light carbonation.",4.21
3400,Hypermash Hydra,This was a complete shocker to me. It's been the first bottle logic beer I've traded back. The thickness is really a turning point I think BL will continue with. No other BL beers to this date have produced this. For the longest time in CA after trading for East Coast beers I wondered why west coast stouts were so much thinner and finally I found something that reminded me of The Answer's Cinammon Papa Boi but bourbon barrel aged. Beyond the thickness I'll admit I have 2 bottles and the first had more Cinammon than the second albeit not overwhelming. It being siagon and not straight cassia bark perhaps made it more exotic. The coffee profile was unreal. Just so decadent overall. A real shocker didnt know BL could do this.,4.79

App: black and thick like dirty motor oil. Dense dark brown head. Initially absent then rises to almost overflow.

Feel: Creamy, think melted haagen-Daaz.
Overall: this is ridiculously good. This is just a balanced masterpiece of an imperial stout. Initially a 5 I realized the one flaw is I can’t really drink much of this chocolate syrup in one sitting.",4.95

Can’t believe I FINALLY got to try this one!!! 2008 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured pitch black with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, dark chocolate, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, wood, sweet alcohol, and milk chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. This was another one that I was shocked to see come out at the birthday party. This was sampled directly after Stormaktsporter. There was a pretty good difference in this one from the base brew. There was a lot more presence of the vanilla with an addition of various chocolate aspects. The cigar aspect I picked up on in the base brew had disappeared, but what replaced it in both the flavor and aroma was just plain excellent. So glad I got the chance to finally try this one and would love to do so over and over again.",4.55

Hell yeah ! 2006 Bottle, served in a wonderful De Molen snifter. It pours pitch black, thick and oily in the glass creating a small but wonderful deep brown head. The wonderful roasted aroma, with the coffee and chocolate notes and a slight hint of vanilla, tar and wood. So complex and as it warms it becomes even better But nothing can prepare you for the taste that is about to follow. The roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, wood notes, some distant ripe fruit. So many flavors , so wonderfully balanced together. What really amazes me though is how easily it drinks despite it’s ABV, you feel like you can have (in my dreams) many many glasses, which is rarely the case with big Imp stouts. I can’t give it anything but a perfect score and I really doubt that I will do this for another beer (certainly hope so though :D ).",5

Smells very good and tastes even better, with a clear but not overdone contribution from the bourbon barrel aging, good balance and complexity.
Sweet full body.",4.18
3466,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I don't think it pours as dark as everyone says. I certainly don't think that light disappears into it like a black hole, and there even seems to be a slight purple/reddish ting around the edges.",4.73
3467,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This beer pours blacker than the midnight sky with a one finger, super fizzy chocolate milkshake colored head. Retention is low and there are sparse chunks of sticky lacing left on the glass.",4.67
3468,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I was really looking forward to this one. Pours black with a coffee-and - cream colored head. Huge Bourbon on the nose. Toffee, molasses and a little char in the taste. Been holding on to this for a while, woeth the wait.",4.56

Some might argue the people are loud and flamboyant, they steal our women, the succer players melodramatically flop on the pitch. Listen - that's all part of the secret Italian ingredient - keep it cool, confident, arrogant and extravagant. Forza Italia."" Brewed in the style of an American Imperial Stout, brewed with natural flavor and aged in Bourbon Barrels. Available in 22 oz. bottles and on limited annual release draft.",4.14
3470,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Poured a thick black almost like oil with very little brown head, Smell is maple, bourbon, coffee, and chocolate with some booze. The flavor is more of the same with a smooth feel. An amazing beer!",4.7
3471,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Absolutely excellent beer. Opened a 2014 vintage that had been properly cellared since purchase. Poured nice and dark. Lighter aroma of oak and bourbon. Flavors had dropped a slight bit, but came together perfectly. Nothing overly prominent, just a delicious mixture of all the flavors. Could drink this all day",4.66
3472,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Evil Twin is a perennial goat for me when it comes to breweries (overpriced, under good), but this is an unqualified winner. Great barrel character. Seek out.",4.5
3473,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This is one of my fav style's of beer and I was very much looking forward to this one after stumbling upon a bottle while looking for something else. I had heard the hype and was excited to try it. I'm not going to say it disappointed me but it certainly did not live up to the hype. Again , not a bad brew but not worth the price point and not up to the talk. Nice aroma and coffee/chocolate are there but kinda weak IMO. Being in Jersey maybe I'm spoiled by Kane's Porters/Stouts - which are clearly superior - but this one didn't do it for me.",4.33
3474,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bomber. Pours black with thin tan head, fades to a ring that lasts. Incredible aroma, vanilla and bourbon and coffee. Bourbon vanilla chocolate shake taste, with some more bourbon. Flavors blend together seamlessly. While boozy, this brew has a ton of flavor, bittersweet chocolate and vanilla finishes it off. Medium slick feel. This one lives up to the hype, well done.",4.6
3475,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This was a fantastic beer. Best enjoyed as a dessert beer after a fine dinner. The hazelnut flavor rings through and walks hand-in-hand with the coffee flavors. Light hints of chocolate in the after taste remind me of nutella. The feel is perfect, it is smooth like a creamy cappuccino. This beer is perfect for rapping up a fine evening.",4.79
3476,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This is another super rich imperial stout. Incredibly thick, black brew with minimal head/carbonation. Smells of bourbon and the wood flavor really comes through more than most RIS. It has this strong coating and chewiness as well. Absolutely spectacular among stiff competition.",5
3477,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Tons of dark chocolate and bourbon in the nose. Also a little vanilla, leather, and faint coffee. The taste starts off with more of the big chewy chocolate, accompanied by some nice bourbon heat. Unfortunately around mid-palate, there is a noticeable drop-off in the flavor profile. Subtle notes of vanilla and oak can be found, but the overall complexity (or lack thereof) keeps this just outside elite status in my opinion. Although the heavy fudgy chocolate on the front end gives a nice impression of viscous creaminess, it seems to finish a bit thin for the style. I will say I was quite impressed by the abundance of bourbon character, without feeling boozy or overwhelming. Overall, it's very very good, and I'd happily drink another.",4.33
3478,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Looks like a typical imperial stout. Smell and flavor are both really heavy on the bourbon, hiding most of the biscotti flavor of the original. Definitely a bit thin. All in all a nice barrel flavor but much like the non-BB version I just don't seem to like this beer nearly as much as others.",3.8
3479,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Met expectations almost exactly. Lovely flavors, but a touch artificially sweet. Not much character to it, but it goes deep on that chocolate cake flavor, so it winds up being rather enjoyable. Worth buying if you see it, not really worth seeking out.",4.29
3480,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This was a significant improvement on the base beer. Like the base, it tastes of licorice, raisins, and almonds. Some chocolate comes through as well. Its very rich on the nose and flavor. The base tastes course and artificial to me, but the bourbon barrel helps to smooth that out. I get a little vanilla from the barrel and I really like how the bourbon integrates with the base beer. The bourbon flavor is pleasant without excess booziness. The mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium and there is a little chalkiness that detracts from the feel. Overall, its a very good beer with a few flaws.",4.18
3481,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Pours dark with a nice head. Chocolate aroma. Nice chocolate start to a nice light licorice middle to a bourbon finish. Exceptional stout. One of my favorite stout breweries.,4.65
3482,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"22oz bomber poured into two pint glasses. Pours a viscous motor-oil black forming a thin sliver of dense head dark mocha head. The head is finely dotted with thin bubbles, recedes exceedingly slowly, and has excellent retention, leaving moderate lacing. The nose on this beer is bourbon through and through. Chocolate notes are unmistakeable, along with a sweet-biscuit - almost cookie - element that is decidedly unique. The palate follows the nose, opening with boozy bourbon, milk and dark chocolate, and an almost chocolate-chip-cookie-like flavor. Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy - not quite on par with the best-of-the-best BB Imp Stouts, but solid. If you had told me that this beer was a slightly more subtle and bourbon barrel aged part of the Southern Tier Blackwater series, I'd hardly be surprised - there's the faintest hint of artificial in the flavoring here: not enough to ruin what is otherwise a very good beer, but enough to be noticed. Ultimately, the various elements of this beer come together to make a very well done Imp Stout. Top of its class? No. Overpriced and overhyped? Without a doubt. But another solid brew from Evil Twin? Most definitely.",4.33
3483,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This is hands down three or four times better than non barrel aged imperial biscotti break. The bourbon adds a nice complexity that also dulls what I would call the ""fake"" flavors of regular biscotti break.",4.5
3484,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This beer looks appropriately awesome, pouring blacker than any beer ought to and with a gorgeous, chocolate brown head. As for taste and texture, there's nothing wrong with it; it certainly checks off all the boxes of what a BBA stout ought to be, so I can't call it a disappointment by any measure. That said, when you charge $25 a bottle, I expect a little something extra to set itself apart, and I can't say this fits that bill. If this were, say, $16 a bottle, I'd highly recommend it. As it stands, I'd still recommend it, but it's far from a must-have.",4.22
3485,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Look: Semi-vigorous pour yields a 3/4 inch mocha-colored head.

3490,Mocha Wednesday,"Pours a dark and muddy brown with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is mocha, toffee, caramel, coffee and soothing bourbon with a kiss of char. Roasty and toasty malts form a resoundingly steady base. Flavor profile is mocha, toffee, caramel and then a searing slice of bourbon and heat. After the heat subsides, the focus goes back to lightly sugary with a heavy malt base. Malts come by way of roasty and toasty. Sweetness comes from more mocha and chocolate than try to outweigh the lingering bourbon heat. Mouth feel is thick and full with a velvety, heavy creamery texture. Overall, hot and booze with some kisses and glimpses of sweet. Balance may be a strong word here, as it veers pretty far on both sides of the heat vs. sweet spectrum, but it does all net out within each dynamic sip.",4.32

3493,Mocha Wednesday,2015 Bottle. 18.6% ABV.,4.35
3494,Mocha Wednesday,This massive beer has been in my cellar for almost a year. The super high ABV would allow this beast to age for several more years. The beer is 50 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A semi-hard pour produced a one finger head that dissipated quickly. The beer is SRM 37 a dark brown nearly black beer that is opaque. The has carbonation bubbles pooling in the middle of the beer. Overall a good appearance. With high ABV I did not expect to see a lasting head or lacing.,4.69
3495,Mocha Wednesday,"It seems like I'm always a day behind when I drink these. Who cares anyway, it's like underwear with the days on them. You honestly telling me you don't just feel like wearing Saturday some Mondays? Anyways, I'm pouring from a 750 ml. 2016 bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out just like the others, way lighter than beers similar in the style. Brown in color with highlights all the way through. The smell is warming bourbon with a mocha backdrop. Raisins and plums evident as well. The taste comes in with that same burning sensation and provides dark fruit notes. A very nice chocolately finish. There is some coffee and mocha presence in there, but for the main part it's slight and if not advertised, I think most would just think of a bourbon barrel aged stout. The mouthfeel is thick, chewy and great for the style. Overall, this has probably been my favorite of these so far. But still nothing blowing me out of the water. I guess I'll just keep swimming.",4.24

3499,Mocha Wednesday,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/27/2017. Pours nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy khaki head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, marshmallow, molasses, licorice, smoke, dark fruit, pepper, and roast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Mild increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Taste of huge nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, marshmallow, molasses, licorice, smoke, dark fruit, pepper, and roast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate bourbon/oak spiciness and light roast/char bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of nutty coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, dark bread, coconut, marshmallow, light licorice/molasses/dark fruit, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness and roast bitterness. Medium carbonation and very full body; with a smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Lightly increasing warmth of 19.9%, with mild lingering barrel booziness after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged imperial stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the huge ABV. Bruery stouts always seem to have a class of their own on the flavor profile. Not as deeply roasty or charred on black/roasted malts like some others; but still extremely rich and complex. Outstanding barrel integration and balance; without feeling overly boozy, tannic, or drying. Very similar to the base beer with big levels of fruity/nutty coffee complexity. A highly enjoyable offering.",4.2
3500,Mocha Wednesday,"Giant killer beer that has the amazing aroma of chocolate, bourbon, coffee, oak, vanilla. Very sweet beer with lower carbonation. Tons of chocolate and coffee with strong bourbon. Amazingly this beer hides it's monstrous ABV. There is a little alcohol heat at the end but it is balanced. This is an awesome beer.",4.49

Nose reveals big ethanol notes (enough to ignite your nose hairs) followed by dark malts. Taste expresses toffee, ethanol and some peppery notes, on a dark malty backbone. Mouthfeel is quite thin with a mild carbonation. This beer is hot!. Overall impressions - young and thin. Let this one sit for a few years.",3.72

3512,Fundamental Forces,"Midnight black pour with a thin brown ring and webbing. Huge aromas of vanilla lead the nose, with fudgey chocolate, full bourbon with potent molasses mash, chocolate truffle, hints of marshmallow and light plum liqueur. Amazing in the potency and complexity while keeping vanilla a star. Taste is a relative disappointment, like FO without the impeccable that has the flavors meld together. Bourbon and vanilla are in one camp, and chocolate truffle in another during the sip. Still delicious, but want more integration. Much warmer than FO too, feel is not as smooth or lush, but instead chewy. Still a wonderful stout well worth your time, but much prefer fundamental observation. The wife liked it",4.44

3518,Fundamental Forces,"2019 vintage poured from fridge temp. Motor oil black with gorgeous brown head. Nose is maple, bourbon, milk chocolate, vanilla, and big roasted malts.

3531,Fundamental Forces,"500ml bottle. Served in a snifter glass. Pours a dark black body, one finger offwhite head, good retention, no lacing.

A bit of smoky malt, strong milk chocolate sweetness, cocoa and espresso from the base beer, lots of bourbon. Flavour is essentially a boozy creme brulee with chocolate brownie batter. Super nice in small quantities. Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, moderate booziness, with a lingering vanilla bean finish.

The smell is very much like German chocolate cake. The sweetness of this beer is something that really grips you right off the bat.

3587,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,"January 1st, 2016 - Also kicking off 2016 is a beer from almost a decade ago: the 2007 Cantillon Lou Pepe. Our assumption is that this is perhaps a little long in the tooth, even for a mythically legendary beer like this, but I have high hopes and great trust in the Belgian craftsmen who have honed this recipe through generations. And it seems that my trust was well allocated, because the smell is absolutely beautiful. Chocolate, cream and with a slight fruity sweetness, even the few ounces at the bottom of my glass unfurl up and out and indulge my olfactory with incredible grace and strength. But the taste is spicier, and while it borrows some of the chocolate from the nose, it expresses more like a mole with that kick. Absolutely fascinating, and delicious, this has aged quite wonderfully.",4.08
3588,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,"Pungently funky with very light fruit notes. Vintage 2013. Pours quite surprisingly clear, pale pink-orange. Taste notes are quite light, carbonation is much like champagne.",4.5

3593,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,"Bottle of the 2013 split 3 ways at Hill Farmstead. Poured a lightly hazy reddish copper with maybe a finger of white head. This was incredibly delicious. Pleasantly funky, with some green apple, and a bit of acidity. Far too drinkable.",4.71

3597,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,"Had this at Hill Farmstead last week. Amazing funk notes on this. Super perfect gueuze, The funk is awesome and sour. Looks great. Pours perfect. The taste is even better than the smell. This was the 2013 LPG.",5

Never will I pay $40 again for a 1/2 bottle of beer... albeit a bomber I shared. But Lou Pepe is on the ""1001"" list and this bottle pushed me over the top of my 502 goal... so I guess the value has been rationalized.",4.16

3604,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,"Honestly was a little bit letdown with this one. To be fair, I had it at a share that included four other Cantillons. It's still a very solid Gueuze, but the lesson learned is that Cantillon simply makes much better beers than this one.",4.17

3610,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,"Pours an almost brown color, with a slight head. Smells a bit funky and citric. There is an intense early tart flavor to this, but it mellows out very nicely.

3616,Heavy Mettle,"Poured from a can dated 2 days ago (fresh!) into a tulip glass. Pours an opaque pale orange/yellow color (like white grapefruit juice) with a pretty aggressive head with decent retention. Scents of sweet tropical punch and candy. I’ve been on a hazy DIPA kick this summer, so a lot of them blend together but this one definitely has some unique notes coming through. The description by Trillium says pink starburst, and I’m definitely getting some of that- really candy like fruity flavor. I’m also getting some bitter citrus and sweet tropical fruits. Lingering bitterness from hop oils on the palate. I have to say this one sneaks up on you at 9+% because you don’t even notice it. So many beers at that level have a very obvious alcohol burn and taste but this one is totally smooth for that ABV. My first time trying heavy mettle (I’ve had one in the alloy series and death mettle) and I think this one is my fav of the bunch. May not be your bag if you don’t like the sweetness that this recipe invokes, but I’m definitely digging it.",4.68

3625,Heavy Mettle,Very cloudy straw color with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is a grapefruit and other citrus without any hoppyness. Taste is a Devine grapefruit that is very smooth and no hops at all.,4.67
3626,Heavy Mettle,"[Original rating 2017-12-26] Draft at Armsby Abbey Worcester MA. Easily one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. I want to just sit and smell it.

The alcohol is very well hidden, does not seem like 9.3%.",4.46
3627,Heavy Mettle,"Another excellent beer from Trillium, this one pours a thick, hazy yellow and smells softly of stone fruits. To the tongue, the peach and nectarine are most prevalent, but there is a little more of a citrusy taste underlying it. The milky texture and grainy undertones prevent this from being too fruity.",4.44

Moderate pour yields a one inch white head over a cloudy, golden body with some sticky lacing. Nose of dank everything. Taste of Columbus hop dankness first, followed by the citrus of Galaxy and Amarillo hops, with a bit of flowery spice from the Amarillo. Normal soft feel for a cloud bomb such as this. Finishes with a moisture-sucking dryness. Overall, I think I'd like this even less if it was fresh and more palate-whacking. Cheers!",4.23
3631,Heavy Mettle,Just an enormously hopped beer that blows beyond what my finicky palate can handle these days. Carry on and pick up the info you seek from a more hop-headed review.,4.14
3632,Heavy Mettle,"Sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into my snifter. The beer pours a hazy orange color with creamy bleached white head of 1 cm foaming up and fading to a sturdy surface layer soon after the pour is complete.
The aroma is the expected citrusy notes of orange and some grapefruit, with also some fresh cut grass and a bit of pine sap and resin. I get just a little bit of biscuity malt buried in the beer and the high ABV is pretty well hidden on the nose.
The first sip reveals a silky texture with very fine and prickly carbonation. The beer dries out intensely on the swallow, but before that I experience a wide range of hop characteristics. I get orange peel and grapefruit rind with some pine sap and again the fresh grass, (especially on the burps). There is a bit of sweetness, but not from malt, more the citrusy fruit notes. I get a bit of peppery alcohol bite on the swallow along with some warming in my belly, but this beer could be consumed quickly, which makes it a little dangerous at 9.3%.
Quite a nice Double NEIPA, Im glad I got to try this one and would do it again if trying to fulfill my hop needs some night.",4.28

Everett
Hill Farmstead Brewery
Date: 18 May 2021
I nearly fell out of my chair when I discovered I was given this beer. Hill Farmstead is on my shortlist for must-visit breweries. They have several beers I want to consume. They have a best-by date to drink: furthermore, I am sure it is okay; it is only a couple weeks past. The beer was carefully maintained to preserve its integrity of the beer. I poured into a Willi Belcher glass; the temperature was 46 degrees. A frothy and creamy three-fingered dark tan head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 24, dark oily brown. The appearance of the beer is beautiful.",4.77
3637,Everett Porter,"16 oz can, canned 7/27, poured into curved pint glass. The aroma is chocolate, roasted grains, cold brew, maybe some cocoa powder. The taste is right in line. And it’s quite tasty. The feel is medium , carbonation low and smooth. Overall, an outstanding Porter worth tracking down.",4.38
3638,Everett Porter,"Canned 5/18/21. Poured into a tulip at ~45 degrees. Black as night, with a wonderful, dense beige colored head with good retention and lacing Looks amazing. Aroma is rich, sweet and malty. Taste is roasted malts & unsweetened chocolate. In typical HF fashion, it 's well balanced in a nuanced way that other breweries don't always nail. Simple, yet complex. Little bit of bitterness, yet smooth. Feel is soft and creamy. Good beer.",4.37
3639,Everett Porter,"Everett from Hill Farmstead Brewing. Received in early June 2021 in Ninja box from @Roy_Hobbs. 16 oz can stored at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 1/7/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Bottom rim stamped “CANNED 05/18/21 DRINK BY 09/18/21”. Served at 53.0 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 60.6 degrees.
Appearance – 4.5.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear.
Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. When rear-lite, opaque but translucent amber brown at the edges.
Head – Large (Maximum 5.5 cm, aggressive center pour), wheat, high density initially but quickly opening, average retention, diminishing to leave a 0.7 to 1.0 cm lacy crown and a thin complete cap. An archipelago of foam islands resembling coral atolls remains on the sides of the glass above the crown. Second pour produces a dense 0.7 cm head.
Lacing – Fair. Wide band of tiny bubbles, separating into two bands, with short, blunt, stalactites. See also above.
Aroma – 4.25 – Begins with roasted malt and cocoa, no hops, no yeast, no coffee.
Flavor – 4.25 – Begins slightly sweet with roasted malt and cocoa and a hint of coffee, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (7 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. Slight gastric warming does occur. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends slightly bitter.
Palate – 4 – Medium, creamy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Very velvety mouthfeel. The first few swallows went from slightly sweet to very bitter with alarming swiftness, but then it seemed to smooth out, just ending slightly bitter in counterpoint to the initial sweetness. Predominant taste and odor are roasted malt and cocoa, with just a hint of a smoky coffee on the tongue. In total, particularly good porter.",4.24
3640,Everett Porter,"I received a can of this famous Porter from @Roy_Hobbs. Canned on 5/18/2021. Poured at 59° into a Willi Becher pint glass. It pours nearly black with very dark cola hues at the bottom of the glass when held to the light, with a large, fluffy, medium khaki-colored had and thick creamy lacing. It's a beautiful pour. Its fragrant nose features dark chocolate, cigar smoke, burnt coffee grounds and charred nuts. Wow, the taste is amazing! The initial chocolate malt sweetness is juxtaposed to acidic coffee (like it's from a Jersey diner), and bitter, earthy, nutty char. There is also strong tobacco. The blend and balance of flavors are exquisite. The mouth feel is rich and creamy - almost stout-like - with mild carbonation, and the 7% ABV seems perfect. Everett is highly drinkable but with excellent substance. This Porter is big and flavorful enough to pair with a fine meal of roasted red meat but you could easily drink a couple of pours casually. Everett's 100 Score is well-deserved. It's as good an American Porter as you'll have the great pleasure of drinking.",4.52
3641,Everett Porter,"From a growler filled at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, poured immediately into a tulip glass.",5
3642,Everett Porter,"The roast profile on this beer is almost unbelievable before even considering it's limited at 7.2% abv. Bittersweet chocolate, city dark roast coffee grounds, and charcoal suggests a grittiness that swirls within a medium-full body that never cloys nor removes focus from the flavor. Tough to tell where roast ends and hops begin, both giving tremendous depth of flavor.",4.75
3643,Everett Porter,"Smells of chocholate with some coffee flavors. This beer is definitely bitter and embodies the true porter feeling. It's not sweet at all. Robust, and a good portrayal of this style.",4.5

3652,Everett Porter,"Pouring from a 500 ml. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer pours out dark brown and forms black in the glass. It forms one finger worth of dense and creamy caramel colored crown. The smell is roastiness with some hop presence almost bringing a resin element into the mix. The taste brings a creamy note into the roastiness, while still delivering that hop presence. Mouthfeel is creamy. This reminds me a lot of Pappys Porter. Must be something about Vermont.",4.38
3653,Everett Porter,Appearance - Pours jet black with big fluffy mocha colored head that leaves tons of lacing all around the glass.,4.51
3654,Everett Porter,"On tap at Beer Shop, NYC.
Pours a thick, viscous dark brown/mahogany with hints of ruby. Modest creamy head that quickly dissipates, leaves a thin ring of lacing.
Nutty, chocolate and cocoa, coffee and roasted malt aroma. Also, a touch of alcohol and dark fruit.
Complex taste that masterfully alternates between the sweetness of the chocolate malts, dark caramel, dark fruit and the bitterness of the espresso roast and earthy hops. Bright and creamy finish that is also sticky, dry and bitter.
Full bodied, rich, robust, yet easy to drink. Smooth and creamy.
Wonderful porter that feels bigger than its 7.50% ABV.",4.5
3655,Everett Porter,"Pours a twilight brown, half inch of creamy head, good retention. Aroma is a very smooth roasted malt, milk chocolate, espresso beans and creme fraiche. Taste is simple but evocative - the malt backbone is deceptively clean, highlighting that roasted malt flavor perfectly, elements of cappuccino, foam latte, burnt nut and pumpernickel. One of the best porters out there",4.72
3656,Everett Porter,"Served on tap in a 10 oz (296 ml) snifter at Beer Noggin in Bronxville, NY.
A: Pours an opaque, very dark brown to nearly black color with a mocha brown head with limited retention (in that style of glass, but modest soapy lacing.
S: Malty with aromas of milk chocolate >> coffee and molasses.
T: Sweet with a flavor melange of dark chocolate and black coffee. Maybe a blackberry note. Light bitterness offsets any excessive sweetness.
M: Full bodied with strong carbonation. Creamy, feels substantive on the palate.
O: Really a delicious porter, almost a stout. Very enjoyable.",4.55

3658,Everett Porter,In review is a 2012 vintage from the cellar.,4.24
3659,Everett Porter,"Enjoying a 2013 vintage obtained in trade, which is apparently not recommended, but I still find it one of the best porters I've ever had. No signs of significant oxidation, and the floral hop character is extremely delicate, surrounded by dark chocolate, earthy cold-brew coffee, and oats. Moderately full body and luscious, silky mouthfeel. Perfect degree of carbonation and a light, medium-dry finish.",4.41
3660,Everett Porter,"This is an extremely good beer. Drank it back-to-back with a 2018 Victory at Sea and in no way does this take a back seat. Dark brown, half-finger head with an aggressive pour. Perfect roasty nose. Not coffee, not shoe leather, not chocolate, maybe a combination of all three? Not sure but a very pleasant and unique aroma.",4.63
3661,Congress Street IPA,"Pours a nicely hazy golden orange color with the most beautiful dense white head you’ve ever seen. The nose is juicy tangerines, mango, and passion fruit (thank you Galaxy!), and there’s a biscuity malt aroma, too.",4.6

Truly a great one.",4.8
3672,Congress Street IPA,"Two finger head with retention on a beautifully light-hearted hazy hue.

3673,Congress Street IPA,"L: pours thick and pale orange in color. Complete haze with 2 fingers if fluffy foam
S: oranges, tangerines, grapefruits, lemons...sweet but with the Rhine peels to balance it with slight twangy bitterness.
T: awesome balanced beer. Lots of citrus, but it has slight peel dank and bitterness near the end but not off putting and actually love the balance. Slight cracker malt in there too. Just awesome.
F: wow, an awesome drinker. Thick, velvet smooth, pillow soft. This is an absolute crusher",4.79

3679,Congress Street IPA,"I expected a little more for the price they are charging. Solid IPA, nothing more. The price gouging makes a ride to Charlton or VT for true world class beer a lot more appealing",3.77
3680,Congress Street IPA,"Pours a bright, opaque orange with a finger and a half of white foam for head. Head retention is good, as is the lacing left behind. Aroma is orange, papaya, mango, melon, and pineapple layered over biting pale and wheat malt notes. Lovely citrusy aroma luring in the lips for a sip. Flavor profile is smooth and round notes of orange, pineapple, melon, and mango. Tropical fruits are suspended over a base of wheat, pale, and biscuity malt notes. Hops absolutely dominate the flavor profile ratio here. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a filling, grainy, velvety texture that drives this beers presence from modest to unabashed. Overall, it's pack-a-punch without remorse. It carries a heavy weight, and manages to deliver it unbroken. Big citrus notes, both domestic and tropical, layered over thin, but firm, malts.",4.5

3686,Double Stack,"Pours a deep brown/black color with a thick tan colored head that sticks around and has some nice lacing down the glass. This beer smells like maple pancakes and a cup of coffee from a serious distance. Up close it's fresh maple, a great cup of coffee, and somehow the sweetness of pancakes. Taste is a smooth coffee, roasted malts, toasted pancake followed by sweet maple and finished off with a sweet coffee finish. Smooth, full feeling, perfect amount of carbonation. Incredible.",5
3687,Double Stack,"16 oz can dated 01/06/2021
Oh Holy Father the aroma as i cracked this open!
Natural maple syrup, pancakes, honey and sweet coffee.
Wow.
And it aint a bad looker either. Black body and beautiful inch thick creamy tan head.
Taste not as sweet as one ( me) would expect but it has all the taste profile of a down home old style diner pancake feed.
Mouth feel is thick and silky. Not one to have multiples off.
Great beer for the style",4.6
3688,Double Stack,"Smells like delicious pancakes. Tastes complex and intriguing, with hints of coffee and maple. Really smooth and creamy. If I changed anything, it would be more maple and less coffee, but then, I LOVE sweet stuff. Overall a great beer!",4.54

3691,Double Stack,Appearance - The beer poured a brown-ish black color with an off-white head crowning the pour.,4.46
3692,Double Stack,"Brownish black with two fingers of brown foam. Smell and taste are clones: huge maple syrup from the local diner with coffee bean, mild chocolate, brown sugar and molasses. Reminds me a lot of Mikerphone's imperial SLBS extra maple variants. Feel is lighter and not syrupy at all though, roasted and malty if anything, amazing given the huge maple presence. Would love to try this in a barrel! A classic that is worth the hype for a great maple fix without saturating the palate with sweetness",4.49
3693,Double Stack,"Huge sugary maple nose, like someone spilled a bottle of Syrup. Full bodied, super slick & smooth mouthfeel. Taste is significantly more coffee-forward than expected, with the maple really coming through on the finish. Hides 11% ABV incredibly well.",4.56

3695,Double Stack,"GREEEEAT Notion. Love love love the PNW and GN. This is one of their best beers and every year we get the Double Stack. Funny we got this in a four pack of cans on drop day because we can't sit and have it on tap (SOOOO good on tap). On the drive home with the four pack sitting on my back seat I looked at Bren and asked ""can you smell maple?"". Of course she could, she is from the east coast where maple syrup is like beer here in Portland OR. Before we opened the can we could smell the maple. So, for those that say they can't get maple drinking this thing... idk what to tell you... ok so we got it home and had our 12 year old daughter help us carry things inside and when she did, she asked what maple did we get... lol... again the cans were weeping maple...",4.83
3696,Double Stack,"On draft at Georgetown taproom some time ago. This beer really left an impression. It was cold and raining when it was served to me. After about 15 seconds of it being on the table outside, I could smell it clear as day, even through my mask. Tons of maple and coffee: absolutely divine. The taste was just as good. Roasted coffee and a bucketload of maple yet so well balanced. The foam laced the sides of the glass as I drank it. Damn near perfect.",4.91

3699,Double Stack,"I had no idea when I traded for this how highly rated it was on here. Sure, it's an American Imperial Stout with all the booze and heft that one would expect, but this was so tasty and wonderful that I didn't even notice how strong it was until I looked at the label. Yeah, this was a beast *but* it wasn't just because of the booze as this had enough behind it to back up it's overt heft. Of course, I thought that was a wonderful thing!",4.53

3701,Double Stack,"Sweet, chocolate coffee, and pancakes with too much maple syrup nose! Ha! The aromatics dissipate a bit as it warms, unfortunately. Taste follows but only subtly sweet...you're hit with the dark chocolate coffee notes with a hint of maple syrup. The dark chocolate notes get more prominent and bitter as time goes on and overpowers the maple for me. It has decent depth, just a smidgen thin for my palate.",4.32
3702,Double Stack,"Nothing to say that hasn’t already been said. Maple, Coffee, Batter. Just a touch thin. Noticed during my beer flight that GN loves a more bubbly approach to their beers. All have been a touch thinner, more effervescent, than expected.",4.48
3703,Double Stack,"A pitch black pour with virtually no last head. Just a thin ring of brown and off-white foam around the rim of the glass. The nose is intensely floral with a concentrated maple syrup aroma. I love that smell and I can't stop sniffing it. The drinking hits with big waves of lovely chocolate malt upfront. The mouth feel is very noticeable with just a thick, and full bodied feel that really coats the mouth and lingers well after each sip. Despite the nose the main flavor on the drinking is the coffee. Big and roasted coffee grinds that finish nicely bitter. I'm mostly getting the syrup note on the finish but its very pleasant and not nearly as sweet as I had anticipated it to be or what the nose suggests. Additional notes of caramel, brown sugar, smoke, charred oak, burnt toast, vanilla, and molasses. Despite it's feel and abv the brew is super drinkable and I'm starting to feel it.",4.79

3705,Double Stack,Appearance: poured pitch black. Appeared slightly thin while pouring and with no presentable head.,4.3
3706,Double Stack,Poured from a 16 oz. can at home. Thanks for the trade Dan! The taste of this follows the aroma with a nice mixture of maple and coffee. Thick. Very enjoyable.,4.5
3707,Double Stack,"16 oz can from Oregon via a friend. Pours a rich thick black with half finger of medium brown head. Aroma on opening can hits with maple syrup evoking a full pancake breakfast - in the glass the aroma remains strongly maple but with definite coffee notes and hints of chocolate.
Taste is sweet maple, vanilla, balanced by coffee/cafe au lait, minimal bitterness, milk chocolate.
Smooth sweet mouthfeel without ever being cloying - creamy with pleasant carbonation. Absolutely fantastic beer.",4.49
3708,Double Stack,"Tasted from can. Pours dark brown with tan head. Lots of maple and coffee on aroma. Taste is sweet with a chewy and sticky mouthfeel. Flavors of maple syrup, molasses, coffee. Awesome breakfast style stout.",4.77
3709,Double Stack,"Every Summer, I make this frustrating mistake of thinking that I’m actually going to spend the entirety of the three four high climate months crushing can after can of refreshing Pale Ales or IPAs. This misconception usually results in me doing something stupid like buying multiple four packs of the same beer thinking that the hot weather will help me power through the beers, and make them feel enjoyable all at the same time, while completely discounting such variables as (1) the fact that the human appetite decreases during warmer seasons; (2) my taste buds seem to get burned out from hops a lot faster in the summer; and, (3) regardless of the season, I’m usually too tired to drink a large quantity of beer after work, so I tend to reach for the higher ABV beers than the lower.",4.43
3710,Double Stack,"Pours really nice with a relatively thick tan head. Smells wonderful, tons of maple followed by roasty coffee. Taste is underwhelming compared to the smell. Neither the maple nor the coffee is as strong as you would expect from the nose, and the base beer is not tasty enough to back them up. Some bitterness comes through, but it's almost burnt-tasting, not sure if that's from the malts or the coffee. Feel is not great. Not really very thick for an 11% stout, and it's a little over-carbed too. Overall, a fairly good beer, but disappointing. I would probably like it a lot more if I hadn't tasted other far-superior coffee/maple stouts like ISLBS and Imperial Falling Colors.",3.96
3711,Upper Case,"Exceptional hope load. Great lupulin bitterness, but balanced. The only way I can fault Upper Case is that it seems a tad watery and could be a little hazier -- related, I supppose.",4.56

3714,Upper Case,On tap in Vermont. I do not remember where. Three Penny? Probably.,4.25
3715,Upper Case,"Very light for it's ABV. Doesn't have the nose of some of Trillium's other IPAs, and is lighter in body than expected for the ABV. The flavor is there, notes of mango and pineapple abound. It might just need a bit more time in the can for the nose to burst free - I will re-visit if that is the case. For now, this is a solid offering with a sneaky light feel for such a big beer. I remember when 9.1% implied Triple!",4.42
3716,Upper Case,"Outstanding beer, and very different. Actually a very similar experience to Big Bird, which I lucked into two years ago as I picked up a flat of Trillium beers in Fort Point on our way to Cape Cod for a bi-annual multi-family trip. I think this one is actually more polished and tasty, fresh, than Big Bird was. But the amazing hop experience is similar. Looks like a muddy pineapple juice, but the aromas and (to a just slightly lesser degree) flavors cover just about every hop-related note I love about hoppy beers. Citrus, pith, berries, mango, musky wine grapes, dank hemp, tropical fruit, wheat biscuit, sugared grapefruit. Absolutely phenomenal. Grassy, but not overly so, which is a nice departure from most NE IPAs. Really nice level of sweetness, as well, and zero green astringency, even fresh, which distances this beer from Big Bird. Feel is a little thin, but that doesn’t take anything away from the amazing, complex, and harmonious nose and tongue. Amazing that you can throw an ungodly amount of different hops together and get such a wonderful end result.",4.39
3717,Upper Case,"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 10/31/16 (yes, I know it's old!) with ""HAPPY HALLOWEEN"" written below it. Sure, this beer was quite filling but the flavors, stickiness, and lack of any massive sediment at the bottom of the liquid led me to believe that this was a quality brew, even down to the last sip!",4.38
3718,Upper Case,"Upper Case pours a thick, murky orange juice yellow with a small, 1-finger ivory white head that leaves little lacing on the glass. The smell has a big tropical fruit aroma with orange, mango and grapefruit with a big bite of danky hop resin. The taste is sweet candied fruit inducing pineapple, mango and good dose of citrus zest with a creamy goodness from the raw wheat. A complex bitterness creeps in finishing rather sticky. Overall, this is a very solid NE style DIPA. Another great beer out of Trillium brewing. Cheers!",4.44
3719,Upper Case,"Draught pour at The Smoke Shop. Nose is mute (opens up a bit once warm) , but the taste explodes with tropical fruit, papaya, guava, passion fruit, mango, kiwi, and some faint citrus. Creamy feel on the tongue and swallow, some ABV burn that drys the palate. Damn delicious brew, just wanted more from the nose.",4.45
3720,Upper Case,Pours an opaque orange gold color with a one finger bone white head that doesn't leave much lacing.,4.35
3721,Upper Case,"One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Went to Trillium over the weekend and tried all the beers on the tap line including Upper Case. Along with Permutation 52 (mentioned in other review), this was my favorite beer of the bunch. All the others were amazing too (including Meddle at a close runner up), but this one had more complex flavors and smell. A great NE IPA style, very juicy, and very smooth for the ABV level. I live in NYC and can say this stacks up very well with some of our favorites from Other Half, Sand City, LIC, etc.",4.85
3722,Upper Case,Wow! Full on blast of overripe mango& pineapple w/ slightly tart resin finish. Extremely slick and thick. Carbonation bursts on my tongue. Outstanding Beer,4.58
3723,Upper Case,"Canned 7/17/18, so a week and a half ago.",4.55
3724,Upper Case,"Had a freshy can thanks to my friend who graciously gifted me one since I threw a bunch of brews his way for a party. When you open the can, it doesn't just greet you with an aroma, it jumps out and punches you in the face. The flavor is wave upon wave of juicy and dank hoppy goodness. It's hard to describe all the flavors since it's like describing the sound of a volcanic explosion: really fucking loud. I get a ton of tropical fruit with berries and dank resin. Mosaic plays the lead role with Galaxy as an obvious supporting job. Serious body commands this to be sipped and enjoyed, but I never got any booze heat or warmth. Overall this is my favorite Trillium to date with Galaxy Cutting Tiles coming in a close second.",4.66
3725,Upper Case,"Oddly enough, this beer is exactly as they described it. Thick, beautiful orange juice pour, Doughy mouthfeel, and loads of papaya, mango, pineapple, and doughy yeastiness. Very well hidden 9%. Really loved this. Very recommended.",5

3727,Upper Case,"I enjoyed this beer, especially the nose. The nose promised bright floral hop perfection, but after taking it on I expected the taste to be different. It is more earthy than I expected. It is a great dipa, but the taste does not invite the next sip as well as other excellent IPAs I've had from this fine brewer.",4.25
3728,Upper Case,"Tasted from can. Pours a hazy gold with white head. Aroma is tropical fruit with lemon. Taste is moderate to heavily bitter. Flavors of lemon, mango, melon, pineapple, resin, caramel. As almost all of Trilliums beer very well done.",4.53

T: Semisweet to sweet. Fruity, in theory, but much more coarsely grainy, in fact. Low bitterness.

Head lasts quite a while and there are significant sheets of lacing during drinking. Aroma isn't huge but has a nice citrus, melon hop aroma along with almost a white grape / wine characteristic of some Brut IPAs I've had recently. Was some Nelson Sauvin used along with the ""almost entirely"" Mosaic? Taste follows the nose with hints of sweet orange juice, melon, pineapple, and again that slight white wine. I say all hints because this is not a huge juice or hop bomb, but rather just a well crafted balanced IPA with many subtle flavours and nothing to blow your socks off or take over the taste. Some grassiness and sweet tartness appear at the end of the sip along with just a hint of non-astringent bitterness to let you taste those hops right to the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately full. This is a very nice IPA, not as big of a taste as I've grown to enjoy, but refreshing & very enjoyable nonetheless.",4.4

3746,Society & Solitude #6,"absolutely incredible ipa here, the original style vermont ipa, before everything had to get all messed up. pure mosaic here too, in a way i havent known these hops to be in many years, like they have actually been juiced, insanely fresh, and like a concentrated version of themselves, its outrageous in both aroma and flavor, lemon and tangerine and lemongrass and pineapple notes, but also some tea and flowers and botanicals, like nothing else. a million or more beers feature mosaic hops right now, but none like this. just a bit hazier looking than expected, this is pretty thick and even faintly green hued, nice head on it, but not the brightest or sexiest looking ipa. who cares when it smells and tastes like this through, bursting with everything i love about mosaic hops and nothing i dont. i almost think for a second there is some lactose in this, not because its sweet at all, but because there is an insane degree of creaminess to the soft and expansive texture, like satin on the palate, like i want to dive into it. bitterness is really low here, especially for how intense the hops are, its its juicy all the way through the finish. subtle notes of marshmallow, french melon, and kiwi fruit here too. overall just a splendid ipa, they way these should be, and a leader in a very crowded style. this blew me away. dying to try the other beers in this series now!",4.46
3747,Society & Solitude #6,"Does anyone taste Lipton Ring-O noodle soup at the end? It's more apparent from the can. It tastes really good not so much in spite of that aftertaste, but because of it.",5
3748,Society & Solitude #6,poured into a pint glass via draft,4.49
3749,Society & Solitude #6,"So, the beer pours a rich looking, apricot amber color with pretty decent head retention and light lacing. On the nose, there's a huge aroma of mango, papaya, apricot and pineapple. The mosaic hop presence is pretty pronounced in this bad boy. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, but the tropical fruit flavor wasn't as intense as I was expecting. Mouthfeel was also a bit less full than I was expecting, though I appreciate the fairly light, dry and moderately bitter finish in this beer. The finish is very clean in this beer, and the alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile. So drinkability is pretty good. This is a very good DIPA for sure, though I don't think it quite matches up with the #7 version I tried last night. However, I think a bit more sweetness and richness on the palate would improve this DIPA immensely.",4.3

3763,Susan,"Pours a bright, completely opaque, orange color. Thick, sudsy off white head forms, then dissipates leaving a quarter inch of foam in the glass along with plenty of sticky lacing.

3776,Susan,"Had this on tap at Henry's Taproom in Saratoga, ny on 2/21/20. As soon as I saw this on the chalkboard there was no other choice. This brewery carries the weight of Ages of brewing quality. Not my first draught of this however, already being in Burlington numerous times. That being said, this is an amazingly subtle NEIPA with so much complexity that you could write an essay on this elixir if you didn't devolve into a blabbering idiot after 3 or 4 of this. My friend met me for 1 beer and it turned into 3 each! THIS IS A MUST-HAVE BEER! The experience of drinking this will make you wax poetic about the ingrained vermont qualities of superior IPA's. Do find this and do enjoy it but please....give your keys to the bartender and Uber home.",4.68
3777,Susan,"Had on tap at HF and grabbed a 750 swing top growler as well.
Stunning looking full creamy head on an opaque hazy soft yellow base. Nose slightly understated but flavor was packed full of mango; pineapple and citrus. Modest dank as beer opened up a bit; but not distracting or overly bitter.
Body was just about perfect and incredibly smooth.
Overall one of the very best IPAs I’ve ever had.",4.54
3778,Susan,"I found Susan on tap at Armsby Abbey on a recent trip to Massachusetts - a bit of a detour, but well worth the drive (for food and beer both).",4.41

Not a strong smell, mostly getting juice some orange juice scent, lots of fruit.
Taste is along with the nose. Lots of orange juice and tropical fruit taste. Extremely smooth and way too easy to drink. You get a little bit of the pine/bitterness at the very end.",4.65
3780,Susan,"a classic from these guys that i am only finally getting to drink now. it may have been a game changer when it first came out, but it certainly isnt anything new anymore. this balance of heavy dry hopping over a hazy base with some substance is now everywhere, and even the hop profile itself seems somewhat classic, more northwestern than southern hemisphere, but its the degree of refinement that has me blown away, which is more manifest in the mouthfeel than anywhere else in this now famous ipa. it is both expressively carbonated and bone dry, while also being drinkable but substantial, round medium body but fast finishing, the right elements of the hops linger too, no vegetal bite or over bittered harshness. it does have some bitterness though, not all juice, and the grapefruity piney flavors, almost assuredly simcoe derived, do have some resolution, but its the between the lines nuances of pineapple, papaya, and juniper that turn me on here. so alive from the tap, almost chuggable for what it is, probably ahead of its time when it was introduced, not decidedly in the middle of whats hot, but this is a quality league or two above just about everything else, including the other ones the nerds all line up for and freak out about. from a flavor standpoint, its great but not revolutionary, but through the lens of quality, its as good as it gets!",4.33

3787,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Tasted in a 6 oz sampler glass from draft at Gold Eagle Wine and Spirits on April 3, 2021. Far too many coffee stouts are overwhelmed by the bitter taste of fresh brewed coffee. This is far more subtle and much better as a result.",4.5

3791,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Had on tap. Poured charcoal black with a finger of brown foam. Smell captures the roast of the coffee beautifully, with dark chocolate, licorice, leather, and char supporting.

An amazing coffee stout",4.58
3792,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Small glass from draught @ Zeezicht Breda. I had this before once from draught, which I remember to be superb. This time: Pours a pitch black colour and a beige/light brown head with short retention. Aroma's: sweet, chocolate, boozy. Retronasal: sweetish, cocos, fruity/boozy alcohol. Flavour is moderate sweet, boozy alcohol. Alcohol is rather sharp. Almost full bodied. a bit too alcoholic. Next time will be better again (I hope).",3.67
3793,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"September 3rd, 2015 - When I leave San Diego, this will probably be the most memorable beer of the many, many beers I had. For one, I had it at one of my first visits to any brewery since moving to San Diego. But it is also an amazing brew. To the eye it looks like a somewhat intense stout, with a brown foam and a thick body, but not too oily. The aroma is big and bold, and cold and saturnine, like the smell of cold metal, but with some cacao nibs on the edge. The flavor is the real appeal here. Creamy, rich but not cloying, it is decadent, and deserving. Huge gushing chocolate notes combine with deluxe and top-shelf coffee notes, like Bird Rock coffee. Better yet, this beer gets spicier as it warms, like a Christmas ale, and reveals shades of nutmeg and cinnamon. Could this be a rare 10 for flavor?!",4.37

3797,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Poured 32oz crowler into snifter. Obsidian in color with huge 3 finger foamy mocha head. Slowly fades into a nice cap and thick collar and webbed lacing on my glass. Roasted malts, coffee, cocoa and rich dark chocolate blend with hints of pepper and earthiness. Flavor is bold with the Speedyway stout base, loaded with bitter chocolate, cold pressed coffee, hints of roasted malt and cocoa. Some earthiness from the hops along with hints of pepper and cream.

3801,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Received this can as an extra back in the summer. Could have sworn I'd reviewed regular ol Vietnamese Coffee Speedway before, but upon further review I found out it was the incredibly rare draft only 'Brewers Blend' rendition I had back in 2012 and incorrectly reviewed under this regular version. Good memories for that beer thanks to JLindros! Canned on 4/25/18. Review #3500.",4.45
3802,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"This beer pours like motor oil. Thick, black. Tan head, 1 1/2 finger. Retention is good, and nice lacing on the glass.
The nose has got a nice mellow coffee aroma. Smooth smelling.
Taste/feel - Rich, and thick. Got a nice coffee flavor, that comes on the front, with a warm boozy finish, but not harsh boozy taste. The body is thick. Has a creamy feel right away when I sip it.
Solid Stout overall. Delicious and fun to drink.",4.44
3803,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Amazing beer. Pours black with a nice beige cap, and awesome lacing left on the glass, especially for a big stout. Nose is dominated by rich roasted malts and coffee. Taste follows the nose, but imho the dark chocolate flavors dominate the coffee. Body is fairly typical for the style, as is the carbonation. The abv is extremely well hidden for a 12% stout. This is an amazing beer, and my only wish is that I could have it more often.",4.65

3805,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,Stout brewed with four different coffee styles. Extremely well balanced with coffee finish and extensive aftertaste. Color is pure and taste is fantastic. Had on tap at Other Half as well. Solid coffee taste and good stout.,4.5
3806,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,"Able to score a goblet on tap from a local Italian eatery...very surprised to find it around here. Slowly, finally, these really good breweries are starting distro in this area. Color is a dark brown. No obvious carbonation but a tiny sliver of head. To touch, the temp was cool to room temp. Aroma was very coffee forward, balanced like a breakfast blend smell. First sips were hot from the alcohol, followed by a smooth coffee presence from front to back of tongue. Mouthfeel was full and left a nice coffee, milk chocolate aftertaste. If I could find this bottled, definitely worth cellaring a few to see how the burn subsides and the flavors develop. It seemed a little one-dimensional fresh, so I imagine aging is a must for this one. The straight Speedway stout seemed to have more complexity fresh. Definitely worth a try.",4.03
3807,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,Had it on draft. Very dark brown color with a creamy brown head and great lacing. Rich chocolate cake smell and taste. Dark coffee and cappuccino flavors become more pronounced as it warms. Hint of strawberry. Very rich and silky smooth feel. Great beer!,4.44

3813,Medianoche - Coconut,"Pours blacker than black, hardly any head coming off this thing. No lacing but does have some flakes of coconut dandruff floating on the surface. The smell is a mix of deep roasted malts and some molasses. The taste is sweet and roasty, some coconut and dark fruit. The feel is slick and oily with a sting to it from the booze. Overall an outstanding stout.",4.43

3815,Medianoche - Coconut,"650ml bottle, snifter glass. Thick and opaque black body, one finger mocha head, good retention. Minimal lacing. Lots of coconut flakes. Smell is sweet, damp coconut water sweetness, big bourbon and oak, whiskey heat, vanillin, milk chocolate. Smooth and creamy milk chocolate soaked in bourbon, slight vanillin, sweet coconut water throughout. A little bit of toasted coconut as well. Full bodied, creamy and thick, viscous and chewy, good carbonation, coconut and bourbon heat all the way through to the end.",4.33
3816,Medianoche - Coconut,The 2018 release of this is truly an elite beer. A fudgy barrel forward base is perfectly balanced with amazing coconut presence. The feel is super thick and perfect and the flavors are exquisite and right on point with the best of them. Great work weldwerks,4.78

3818,Medianoche - Coconut,"Dark pour, no head. Copious amounts of coconut on the nose. Tasted shortly after BA Aurox Cocoa/Coconut (which I thought had too much carbo) and thought the Medianoche was a bit flat. Maybe making BA beers isn't as easy as I thought? Overall, it's a nice BA coconut stout but I have other favorites.",4.33

3820,Medianoche - Coconut,Black with burnt red edges and a fizzy tan collar.,4
3821,Medianoche - Coconut,"for all the hype around this, and the others in the series (this being my first of them), i was a little let down by this, as good as it is. its awesome beer no doubt, but seems almost big for the sake of being big, less balanced than many of their others, and frankly a little sloppy at the seams, especially when it warms up a bit, but thats being critical i suppose. the beer is thick and deep brown, long legs on the edges of the glass like a big cabernet, not much head after the initial pour. sweet sun tan sort of coconut to this, pungent even above the huge dark malt base, but with a surprising degree of toasted nuttiness and bitter roast on the back end, there is a lot going on here, but the coconut feels forced to me, like it could be scaled back in a somewhat lesser beer, its overly intense, despite tasting great, its less of a natural union than i had imagined. some alcohol burn here though the residual sweetness, which has an almost toffee flavor to it, more than a suggestion of coffee, bold vanilla, and sticky caramel. it could use a little more carbonation, it drinks like blacktop sealant honestly. its cool beer, but for this variant anyway its overhyped and not as dialed as the rest of the weldwerks portfolio seems to be. still amazing beer, a must try for those who dont mind a little of the sweet fakey over the top coconut, but it might be a better beer without that element...",4.18

3823,Medianoche - Coconut,"Poured from a 375 ml bottle into a Bourbon County tulip, with a dark black color and small khaki head. Smell was dominated by coconut. Taste was Dark fruit, milk chocolate, vanilla, loads of coconut, and a bit of tannic dryness. Coconut forward, but balanced. ABV is well hidden.",4.5
3824,Medianoche - Coconut,"375 mL bottle. Black body with no head. Smells of coconut and lots of chocolate. Some bourbon. Tastes really nice. Coconut is really strong. Bourbon behind it. Some chocolate. Hefty oak. Dry oak and booze, just like the vanilla variant. Boozy finish. Heavy with low carbonation. The coconut flavor just elevates it above the vanilla.",3.96
3825,Medianoche - Coconut,Had this at a share in line for BA Chainsmoker....had been meaning to track it down! This beer was heavy on the coconut! Very impressive! Needing more!!!!,4.9
3826,Medianoche - Coconut,Tan head. Black in color.,4.72
3827,Medianoche - Coconut,Loved this beer. One of my favorite coconut stouts I've ever had. Right up there with Snowed In for me. Had this side by side with the Vanilla version and liked this a touch better. I'm a sucker for coconut.,4.75
3828,Medianoche - Coconut,"Celebratory birthday beer for my wife. Nose is intense and let's u know right away they didn't skimp-out on the crazy good adjunct. Bourbon, chewy, toasted coconut and marshmallow. As much coconut as Prop14, but lacks the complexity and smooth nature of a Prop. Really impressed tho",4.5
3829,Medianoche - Coconut,"Nose is of huge coconut, chocolate, vanilla and walnuts. Taste is just as good, big time coconut and chocolate, followed by coffee and a slight nut flavor, like almonds or hazelnuts. Beer goes down smoothly but the mouth feel is just right, not thin but not too thick, an excellent balance!",4.91
3830,Medianoche - Coconut,"Poured from a bottle (received in trade) at 55 degrees...
Nice black pour with thin tan foam, nice coating of the glass...
smell is incredible--mounds bar on steroids...
taste is coconut and unsweetened baker's chocolate, with a slightly strange flavor that I can't pinpoint-- not unpleasant, just noticeable and slightly distracting (it may grow on me!)...
Hides the alcohol well, and nicely-not-sweet (hate overly sweet stouts)...
Overall, a delicious coconut stout that's crushable,... I still prefer prop 13 (and snowed in) for more barrel/coconut/concentration.... but this is a close second (next up, coconut ANTEAD)",4.31
3831,Medianoche - Coconut,"Poured from a first batch bottle into an Avery rare beer snifter. Straight up coconut on the nose. Absolutely no trace of the promised 14.5%. Taste is coconut as well; finally, a coconut beer that delivers! As it warms up, the coconut gives way to the underlying barrel, making for a wonderfully balanced barrel-aged beer: not too sweet, but undeniably barrel-aged at length. Only complaint is that it doesn't come in a 750ml format. Love it.",4.95
3832,Medianoche - Coconut,Format: Crowler - March 2016,4.71
3833,Medianoche - Coconut,"Review is based on the bottle release, which has been the best of the 3 coconut releases thus far. Pitch black pour recedes to a small mocha head. No lacing. Smell is coconut lather - not sweet nor perfume-laden, but very aggressive. Taste follows, with rich coconut and vanilla flavors throughout. Barrel is a bit subdued. It's whiskey forward at first, but quickly mellows, and lacks that oak or charred wood complexity on the finish. Alcohol presence is minimal, but that 14.5% will hit you before you finish. Mouthfeel is slick; each sip quickly subsides, leaving a coconut-meets-brown-sugar residue reminiscent of a cookie or granola bar. All in all it's a great beer, and real treat. I could drink an entire bottle but for my palate it's best split. That said, it's far from my favorite variant (S'mores and Coffee maple are clearly ahead of this one for me), and I probably won't actively seek out more.",4.27
3834,Montmorency Vs Balaton,"A: pours up a murky reddish grape hue, with a quickly receding, white, one finger head.
S: Immediate, cherries and notes of funk and tannic oak. There is something here also that comes off a bit like sugary cereal.
T: Surprisingly subdued, it is sour, but not brutally so, and the cherry is certainly there but I got some baking spice, what seems like cinnamon in the finish and definite (although more subtle) funk . There are also some other more subtle notes of dark fruit and oaky tannins.
M: surprisingly full, but still bone dry.
O: This is an interesting beer, it is much more subtle, nuanced and complex than I was expecting it to be. Full disclosure, I’m not a real kriek/Cherry sour fan, so I bought this on reputation alone and while I don’t think my mind has been changed about kriek, I do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer. I think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own. Fruited Sour beer has never been my thing and it’s still not, but I will say that if more these beers handled their subject with the grace and restraint on display here, I would be more inclined to buy them.",3.96

3839,Montmorency Vs Balaton,"16.9 oz fancy/wasteful bottle poured into a tulip glass. Appearance is light red/pink with a moderate off-white head.

Flavor – 4.5 - Begins and ends with tart cherries, no hops, no malt, no alcohol (6.1% ABV) flavor or aroma, no dimethylsulfide, no diacetyl. A bit of the tartness may come from the tannic acid from the barrel aging, but the barrel is otherwise not noticed.

Aromas of huge sour/tart/tangy red/black cherries, fruit skin/pits, lemon, lime, peach, plum, pear, apricot, red/green apple, currant, red grape/wine, oak, peppercorn, hay, straw, grass, wheat, cracker, and white bread; with light notes of leathery/musty Brett funk, red wine vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness.

O - one of the best wild ales I've had. Stunning.",4.36

There is a little lactic tartness, but it's smoothed over by the cherry sweetness. Hints of rye bread and earthy malts and hops round it out. Flavor profile is cherry puree. Woah. Hints of lemon, lime, and yeast smooth and balance it out, but the storyline is cherries. Mouth feel is medium with a fuzzy, velvety texture that makes for playful sips. Overall, big cherries with a tightly controlled saison underneath. Really well done.",4.47

3853,Montmorency Vs Balaton,"Look: Pours a vibrant pink color with minimal head
Smell: Cherries, a touch of oak, and some acidity
Taste: Follows the nose, tons of cherries. There is a good amount of tartness to this beer as well, with just a little bit of the barrel coming through on the end.
Feel: Fairly light, good carb level, if anything a bit low but works in this beer
Overall: This beer is a great example of cherry in a beer. But it doesn't do much else. It somewhat one noted and a bit on the tart side. It's a nice sipper that may not quite live up to the hype for me.",4.07

3857,Montmorency Vs Balaton,"Poured a deep red fruit punch color with no head. Aroma is very sweet and juicy with heavy notes of tart cherries. Even picking up the sweet maraschino cherries from the jar. Not much barrel character though. Then at first sip, it starts dry but as it warms up, it immediately showcase the sweet, juicy tart cherries. Very fruity, like sweetened cherry juice added. The sour is is not too harsh, allowing the sweet malt to carry through, making the beer almost drink like candy. There is heavy carbonation that oddly seems to reduce at room temp. Overall, a very approachable sour that doesn’t fall short on the added cherries!",4.5
3858,Montmorency Vs Balaton,Blend 3. Nice cinnamon to the nose - slightly unexpected in a cherry beer. Rich and thicker than most cherry beers - none of the thin cough syrup that I've come to expect from cherry fruit beers and sours. Light barrel notes. Quite good. Really bucks expectations - I like this beer as much because of how it surprises me as how genuinely good it is!,4.5

Pours a thick black opaque color with just a little film of tan head and minimal scant lingering lacing. Smells outstanding, great dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, malt, toffee, bourbon, oak, nuttiness and a little raisin. Taste follows the nose, but not quite as rich or flavorful as I was expecting. Almost like a flatter regular coffee stout. Lacked some depth and complexity. Not as creamy or smooth as most oatmeal stouts either, but still had a nice velvety mouthfeel with good carbonation.

3879,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,"2018 release. Received from @woemad in a BIF box. Poured into a pub glass. It pours a dark walnut with cola hues at the bottom of the glass. The creamy, medium mocha-colored head faded slowly leaving a thin film of lacing inside the glass. It's highly aromatic with roasted malt, oatmeal, bourbon, freshly-brewed coffee, caramel, nuts, cocoa, tobacco, and earthy char. The taste opens with notes of both fresh and burnt coffee, oats, bakers chocolate, burnt nuts, leather, and char. As the glass breathes and warms, I'm noticing more caramel sweetness and just a hint of black cherry on the tip of the tongue. The bourbon is clearly evident but it doesn't overpower the other flavors, which are nicely balanced and nuanced. Despite the burnt notes there is surprisingly little bitterness at the finish. This Stout has a thick, creamy mouth feel with low/moderate carbonation. There is no escaping the 13.6% ABV, which is more than just warming. Sip this one slowly. Savor it because it is one of the best Oatmeal Stouts you'll encounter. Thanks, @woemad for the chance to drink this exquisite Stout.",4.59

I had trouble getting the very hard cap off (no proper opener at hand), and 1/4 of the beer was driven out by the carbonation before I succeeded. Drank it at temp. appr. 14 degrees C. Beer was murky brown with floaties, large tan head. Aroma was malty sweet with prunes, figs, dates, chocolate and cedarwood. Flavour was again malty sweet with prunes, figs, dates and chocolate.

Aroma is pretty mellow, there is some molasses, bourbon, fudge, tobacco, and oak qualities.
On palate is a beautiful blend of decadent barrel sweetness that really develops as it warms – there is caramel and vanilla truffles, rich fudge, some roasty character invoking roasted nuts, plenty of oaky wood quality, burnt brown sugar, molasses, marshmallow covered in melted bourbon chocolates, toffee, warm spice quality. Dark fruit flavor becoming more noticeable as it warms and opens up, definitely some raisin in there and a licorice flavor dancing around. Lots of complexity led by some truly decadent flavors, a perfect brew to enjoy on a holiday evening. I am sipping on this one with family over the course of a few hours, must say that the flavors are always delicious but become absolutely stunning about an hour in.

S - Sweet dark vanilla, toffee, coffee, white oak, cedar, a bit of alcohol in the nose
T - Wow, complex, toasted malts, dark cocoa, mashed with vanilla bean, cinnamon, tobacco, anise, and a hint of smoke
M - Thick in body, palate is fully coated with a slick feel. alcohol cleans that up, just enough to keep things moving, linger is sweet and dark
O - What a treat, so well constructed, the bourbon barrel adds to an intense stout.
World class on all levels",4.42
3932,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"Bottle date of August 2013.
Cracked on a nice warm October night.
Look: Pitch black like the bottles namesake pooch.
Smell: Sweet melted caramel toffee, charred oak. Smells a little hot for 10.5 points.
Taste: A huge hit of bourbon, the base stout is in there somewhere but I can't quite place it. Fairly sweet and boozy overall.
Feel: Thin to medium mouthfeel.
Overall: This bottle being four years old maybe past it's prime unfortunately. I can almost imagine the stout being more robust in taste and thicker in mouthfeel. Now that the stout is starting to fall apart the barrel treatment is overpowering and is out of balance.",4.03
3933,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"I don't normally start by stating the overall impression of the beer, but Damon is quite possibly my platonic ideal of a barrel-aged stout.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
This is definitely a labored metaphor, but remember the first time you tried Everett and realized all other porters are child's play compared to Shaun Hill's magnum opus ""Robust Porter""? If there were a genre of beer called ""Robust Barrel-aged Imperial Stout"" Damon would definitely fall right into that categorization. Every little complex nuance that captivates fans of dark viscous liquids aged in wooden containers is amplified beyond the wildest of imaginations, while at the same time striking a perfectly harmonious symbiosis.",4.96
3934,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"got to Westbrook in May on way to Maine and they HAD this on draft only. OMG! Normally don't do volume drinking but since my wife was there, and NOW driving, I had a second one. I've had Cake before but this was Cake on steroids. Peppery to be sure but just superbly well done. Not for the faint of heart, mine stopped for awhile, but I came to and all was right in the kingdom.",4.46
3935,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2018 bottle - flavors still pretty sharp, with nice heat and plentiful barrel notes. Maple and coffee are subtle, but it all works together really nice.",4.75
3936,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2018 version. Was pretty spiced and not that maple forward. Was still very tasted and had a good bourbon spicy mix, with a little sweetness on the end. A little thin, but solid ba spicy/sweet stout",4.17
3937,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"At 55 degrees pours jet black with the barest fizzy thin dark brown head; poor cap retention; thin ring disappeared quickly; small dots of lace with swirl; heavy long syrupy legs. Strong aromas of bourbon and maple, followed by vanilla and coconut; some booze on the retro nasal. Chillies pepper sauce, sweet maple, brown sugar; dark bittersweet chocolate, Baker’s chocolate; bourbon, vanilla and toasted coconut; dark fruit in the middle - plums and sugared raisins; finish is spicy chillies, bourbon and sweet maple. Medium body, smooth silky feel; light carbonation; pepper burn/alcohol bite all over tongue; warmth from 10.2% abv; not thick or adjuncty feeling. Overall, the “Mexican Cake” is solidly present with plenty of spicy chillies with a hot tamales sauce linger; and there is plenty of sweet maple and underlying chocolate to balance the heat; layers of barrel aromas/tastes of bourbon, vanilla and toasted coconut, and digging down, dark fruits; reminds me of CBS, and Morning Wood (without the adjuncts feel) for Maple content, but more complex which elevates into layers of bourbon and spicy peppers and barrel notes for a delicious slice of Mexican Cake drizzled with maple with two shots of bourbon poured on top for good measure!",4.78

3939,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Vintage 2018, drank on Feb 17th, 2020. I'm really impressed by the way in which the maple has held up in this beer - it's not just an adjunct flavor, but also a richness to the texture and mouth feel that make it different from the standard Mexican Cake (or barrel-aged variants). The spices play surprisingly well with the sweetness of the maple - I'm really surprised by this in particular. It's not something that sounds great, but the final product is quite good. The barrel is very nice to boot - mellow bourbon, smooth, no alcohol burn.",4.66
3940,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Super excited to try a BA version of one of my favorite beers, let alone a maple barrel version! Smell takes on more of the flavors from the original: cocoa, cinnamon, vanilla, hot peppers, cake breadiness, black strap molasses, slight dark fruit and smoke, plus then the bourbon and wood from the barrel, maple is there but faint. Not as pure smelling as original, but heavier. Taste is incredible, so much complexity, take all of those aromas from the smell, add smoky maple, caramel, and rich malt work. Finish has good kick from peppers, plus counters the sweetness and robust barrel well. Feel has the spice, has deep richness, has robust barrel elements, sweet adjuncts, and some graininess too, just so much goodness. An amazing beer, apparently I rated the orignal higher, but honestly for me they are equals, just depends on your mood",4.68
3941,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Poured from a 22oz bomber into a Westbrook tulip glass. Allowed to warm over an hour.,4.7
3942,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Dark cola with a mocha head that quickly recedes to an ever-present ring with no lacing. Thick heavy alcohol legs coat the glass when titled. Aroma is bourbon, maple syrup, and chocolate. Taste is sugar, big time chocolate, cinnamon, bourbon, and habanero in that order. It is very complex, and the flavors compliment each other instead of conflicting with each other. There is a long lingering peppery burn which makes this beer standout to me in comparison to Hunahpu’s and Abraxas. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and coating. Overall this is an absolute treat. I love the base beer, but the Maple Bourbon barrel treatment makes an amazing beer world-class.",5
3943,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I found this variation to obviously be of the same commendable quality as ""plain"" BAMC, but a bit sweeter with a touch more raisin. I didn't really get the smoky, caramelized maple flavor I was hoping for, but hey, can't complain about getting another version of barrel aged Mexican Cake. It still has that distinct spicy heat with a slick, thin body that finishes semi-dry.",4.13

L: Dark mocha hues with a rich sandy head and minimal lacing
S: Tons of peppers and cinnamon ensconced in a delicious dark amber maple
T: Sticky Grade B maple met by a muddled, but pronounced and welcomed heat by the habanero; followed up with a sweet vanilla frosting and fudge on the finish
F: Nice and rich - not crazy thick, but aided by the gooey maple
O: One of my favorite BA Cake variants. Outstanding depth of flavor and rich maple notes - just incredibly done.",4.8

3952,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"650 mL bottle. Black body. Smells of peppers, bourbon, chocolate, bourbon, and a little maple. This thing is aggressively spicy. More than the regular bourbon. Chocolate. Bourbon. Maple sweetness and lingering spice. Heavy and sweet. A little boozy. I prefer the regular bourbon over this. A little too sweet and even though it's much spicier, it doesn't elevate it.",4
3953,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Good beer. Way to overhyped. If you have a chance to try it then go for it. But not even close to being worth what people are asking. You've been warned.,4.15
3954,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I couldn't have been more impressed with this beer. Loved the sweetness from the maple and the spices came through very well. Of the Cakes I've had, this is 2nd to the Double Barrel version from a couple years ago but not far off at all. Would be happy to try this one again.",5

3958,The Abyss,"Has anyone ever said, “I cannot wait to drink this glass of what looks like boiled motor oil?” Well motor oil comes out of the container looking more like an IPA so that adjective (oily) never seemed correct. Dirty motor oil, I guess.
If my car ran on The Abyss I would do much more walking and biking.
It’s dark. Like an abyss! Wow, ironic!
It smells like cocoa malt candy joy. It smells like Jamaican Blue Mountain if it was half as good as they say.
The taste absolutely follows. It’s all been said before. Malty chocolate caramel licorice dark fruit heaven. It’s good! There’s some alcohol in that taste, however, more than most are willing to say.
You guys try that French toast version that’s around in 2021? Odd! Add cinnamon and maple to the above and you have it.
It’s good. As I have said here before, better does exist. BBA Darkness, for example. But Abyss is lovely!",4.58

Very unique flavor, enjoyable and highly drinkable.
Very good. So happy to have been able to visit Hill Farmstead...highly recommended to all.",4.18
3988,Double Nelson,"Had on tap. Cloudy dirty gold body with a thick white foam ring. Love the nelson sauvin hop and love what HF has done with them. Grape must, earthy hops, lemon zest, peach, slight grass, black pepper, and mango aromas. Taste has the same flavors but the malt meets them all in a dry cracker way, the combination gives the beer a dry, resinous, and elevated finish. Smell delivers more on the promise of the hops. Feel captures the dry earthiness in a matrix of a neipa, good juicy orange and yellow fruits.",4.4

Medium body with a slightly dry mouthfeel. Great showcase for Nelson Sauvin hops.",4.39
3990,Double Nelson,"Pours a grainy golden. There's a dank note that you may smell in some parts of the city where youths are skipping class to take part in other, once questionable, but not decriminalized in some states behavior. It smells like week and there is definitely a note of it in flavor too. There's a quiet peppery bitterness on the finish. Overall, it's well-made, just not even my favorite beer involving Nelson from Hill.",4.03
3991,Double Nelson,"Very good NE style IPA, that is, hazy unfiltered IPA which is in fact brewed in NE. It's called Double Nelson so I'll assume they're really trying to focus on the Nelson Sauvin hop. That white wine flavour which accompanies this hop is the primary hop flavour in the profile, and I've been somewhat put off by this in the past, especially with Brut IPAs, but here it is really well done, leading to a very nice flavour, smooth mouthfeel, and pleasant sweet finish to each sip. Hill Farmstead is off the beaten path, not the greatest to get to, & my god, do they take their damn time getting the line up to move through their brewery. I would say Treehouse or the Alchemist can move people through about 3 times as fast with the same number of staff. So, while I have enjoyed the Hill beer I've had, I doubt I'll make it back there again.",4.35
3992,Double Nelson,"Double Nelson pours a murky golden orange color with a small quarter inch, white head, which settles quickly, rimming the glass and some very spotty lacing. The smell is quite dank, with a grassy, earthy weed and pine softened by citrus fruits of orange, pineapple, some white grape with some nice malts and assorted grains resulting in a creamy aroma. Wow! Nothing short of excellent! Lush and creamy over the palette making this very easy drinking. Hints of white wine, grass an herbal notes with grapefruit and pineapple with some pricky spiciness but a soft texture all the way through.",4.6

4029,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,"FRom the bottle, it pours a stygian brown/block color, blocking all light transmission, with a modest light brown head that remains and leaves lacing as you enjoy it. The nose is lovingly smothered with scents of maple, chocolate, caramel, almonds and fudge ice cream. In the mouth, it smoothly runs over the tongue leaving behind tastes of bitter chocolate, fudge and a touch of maple syrup. Wow!",4.27

4034,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,"My first Trillium in quite awhile, so I am really excited for it. It's hazy and looks like any other hazy IPA. Some others are brighter and more Instagramable I suppose though. As with the best IPAs, I'm loving the balance here between sweetness and malt. It has a nice dry finish with bitter tart fruit. It's not overly juicy, but I'm assuming that's not the goal here either. A great beer! I wish I could share it if I weren't under a sheltering decree by our governor!",4.56

Nice fully hazy dark orange with fluffy head and lacing.
Tropical hop presence you’d expect from a neipa.
Balanced bitterness. A little soapy and piney.
Silky mouthfeel.
Not super strong hop flavor or aroma. This may be intentional or because the can Is a couple months old.",3.94
4038,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,"Tastes like orange juice mixed w/beer, not bad at all. Not sure about a perfect 100, but it’s good. Smells a little musty.

4043,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,"Beautiful pour of milky orange, medium head and lots of lacing. Nose is grapefruit juice, a bit of resin. Flavor has the hop resin more forward, with herbal notes over a powerful pith core. The finish is surprisingly mild, given the grapefruit emphasis. Tasty and beautiful.",4.5
4044,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,I picked up several cans and the beer is almost perfect. The fruit taste and aroma stand out. I loved the beer but the staff at the Canton location were not friendly. A simple thank you would have gone a long way to enhance the experience.,4.91

4056,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,"Pours a slightly murky starburst dark orange with a finger and a half of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is earthy, citrusy, tropical fruity hops with a sprig of bready and earthy malts. Together it nets out a modestly sweet aroma. Flavor profile is tropical fruits and citrus packed in front of a lightly rindy, earthy, herbal hop blend. Hops are stacked on top of bready and earthy malts. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a very soft carbonated texture. Overall, fun and playful with slightly rindy earthy, citrusy hops that keep it drinking smooth and balanced. Not a typical juice bomb.",4.14

Big smells of that vegetal onion mosaic pineapple that is typical from that hop. The flavor follows the nose. All Mosaic. Kind of disappointing because the dry hopping over powered the entire beer. It is a mosaic bomb unfortunately, and I do not love that hop.
Love the Galaxy version of this",3.98

Pine, pungent citrus fruit like mango, and fresh spring grassy goodness. Soooo smooth and creamy in the finish and feel. One of the finest examples of a properly-hopped APA with everything you look for in the style and in a craft beer in general. One of those beers you could drink every day without complaints.",4.65

4077,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,"Went to Boston from Alabama with the express goal of getting the New England IPA experience (this is an APA I know). Almost every IPA lived up to their hype; however, I must say this one was riding Trillium's hype train. That said, everything else from Trillium nailed it.
Look: Moderately hazy darker orange with several smaller floaties. Only Trillium beer tried with any distinguishable sediment. Still a very pretty beer.
Smell: Citrus and earthy flowers. No grass or weed.
Taste: Citrus with significant bitterness. Not the juiciness found in their other beers.
Feel: Great light body for an APA. Almost heavy enough for a lighter IPA.
Overall: Definitely a great beer. No doubt there. I must say, after having their other beers, Trillium offers significantly better. One issue was that there was no date on the can, but it was bought directly from the brewery so assumed a couple weeks old maximum.
If anyone in the Southeast would like to know what this is like, go grab a can of Tropicalia from Creature Comforts. That's what came to mind while drinking it.",4.19

4083,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,"Season 16|17 Blend No. 51 - drank November 2nd, 2019 while cleaning out a few bottles of lambic. What truly stands out to me about this blend is that it's quite absent the typical apples that define many geuzes - the tart and sour notes are far more present, and the beer doesn't have quite the same body. Lots of oak notes dominate as well. It's funky, but only lightly so.",4.5
4084,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,"Pours a clear, deep golden amber coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smell is dominated by quite rich, musty, blue cheese funk and tart and fruity yeast esters of green apple, pear and gooseberry, as well as some lemongrass, hay and musty oak. Taste is a superb balance of quite rich and nuanced musty, moldy, cheesy funk, expressive, tart, fruity and slightly spicy yeast esters of green apple, pear, apricot, white grape, gooseberry, lemongrass, clove and white pepper as well as a distinct earthy, musty oak presence and lighter notes of hay, white vinegar and sulphur.

Flavour is similar; there is more of a moderate acidic presence behind the oak and white vinous character. Light cereal grain, mineral and cobweb funk. This is one of the best saisons as far as the flavour goes; the complexity is fantastic. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart and a little dry, and the glass seems to empty itself a bit too quickly, strangely enough. Vinous and light vinegar acidity finishes things off.

4124,Art,Purchased one year ago at the source. Pours a cloudy yellow. Aroma is super funky. Taste largely follows. As it warms it becomes much better. Not sure I get much wine barrel in this.,4.34
4125,Art,"B3, hoppypocket, can't thank you enough. Tons of barrel on the nose. Tons of wine barrel, good mineral notes, decent sour. Different and not quite what I was expecting (not in a bad way) would drink again ;-)",4.49
4126,Art,"Perfect slighly hazy golden color. Was extremely active in the bottle before pouring. The smell was pleasantly funky and tart...you can smell it the second it pours. The taste blew me away...zero flaws as far as I'm concerned. Everything good about Arthur with the added complexity and tartness from the wine barrels. Even has a bit of vanilla flavor in the aftertaste which was very nice. Less carbed than I was expecting and that's not a bad thing...almost creamy, which I didn't expect either but I really really enjoy. This may just be the best beer I've ever had. Wish I could drink this every day.",5
4127,Art,"wow--- what a funky nose---apple meets barnyard funkiness... however, the flavor is a little more restrained and not quite up to the nose... a seriously delicious BA saison, but I have to agree with another reviewer, its no le sarrasin!... next up is Ann so ill have to see how it matches up.... life is rough!",4.48
4128,Art,"Batch 3 at a bottle share. This is a stunner and greatly exceeded my expectations. I actually liked this better than Ann, so I'm a bit surprised by the lower ratings.",5
4129,Art,"L: dark straw
S: tart, Meyer lemon flesh, green melon, green grapes
T: same as nose plus french oak. Tart with a hint of sweetness in the finish.
This is the best beer that I have ever tasted",4.9

4134,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of black cholate, bourbon wood and some tobacco notes is very interesting. Taste is a great mix of black chocolate notes with some light residual sugar notes, some bourbon and woody notes with light vanilla and some dominant tobacco notes. Body is full with oily texture and good carbonation. Quite the extreme imperial stout with tobacco playing a bigger role then I was expected.",4.25

4136,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"absolutely beautiful beer ... dark pour with a frothy mocha head that hangs around for a while and leaves sheets of lace on the glass. aromas are bourbon soaked chocolate, molasses, and roasty malt. opens up on palate with a huge blast of vanilla and delicate caramel character, sweet milky chocolate, toffee, candied wheat, mellow earthy coffee roast, molasses, and dark roasted malt. there is an assertive and slightly spicy bourbon flavor but its so well integrated into the rest of this robust and complex beer that it manages to be simultaneously bold and restrained. mouthfeel is medium+ and oh sooo lush ... not quite sludgy but just perfect for this brew. overall im blown away, this might be the best BA stout ive tasted.",4.82

4138,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Hands down the best stout I've ever had. Might be a bit biased because I had it while at HF and in a perfect scenery but the mouthfeel is unbelievable. As silky as can be, plus the nose just bursts with coffee notes. Glad I was able to get this vintage bottle on site.",5

4145,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Fresh batch released on May 2017. Bottle splitted 4 ways. Black as night liquid with a foamy dark beige head. Nose is coffee, some notes of acidity (cherries or simply coming from the coffee?), chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, lovely! I can’t stop smelling the beer. Astonishing taste of well dosed coffee, residual sugar, milk chocolate, vanilla and bourbon, everything is so balanced, the glass clearly doesn’t last long, I would grab another bottle and drink it all! Abv% is hardly perceptible, medium to full body. One of the most amazing imperial stout I had the chance to drink!",4.74

Really fantastic beer. Happy to share this with my best friend and brother. Unfortunately, the Blackhawks sucked in Game 1 and didn't make this experience complete with a win as we hoped. This was our first Hill Farmstead offering and it did not disappoint!",4.71
4150,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Poured from a 22oz bottle into a taster. Thanks Brandon for sharing this.,4.45
4151,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Loved this. Poured very dark...almost pitch black. Smell has some sweetness and coffee notes. Flavor is a wonderful medley of coffee followed by subtle sweetness (from the barrel?). Feel is excellent, good carb. Overall, another magnificent beer by HF.",4.65
4152,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours pitch black with a nice two finger brown head. With very little lacing. Aroma is booze. Taste is is sweet marshmallow, huge maple syrup,and booze.
Mouth feel is very light for a bourbon stout and super sweet. Had a hot booze finish. I'm a huge bourbon stout fan and this sadly falls off. Big fan of hill IPAs.",4.24
4153,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"I really quite enjoyed this beer. First open, pour khaki colored head, lovely bourbon notes and subtle coffee. Taste for me was oak, spice from the barrel, bourbon and roastiness of the stout, not a whole lot of coffee though. I found it to be very balanced and well made, one I will always seek out.",4.91
4154,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Had this next to Genealogy (On tap in Lincoln, Nebraska)",5
4155,La Fosse,"Gold in color with a faint haziness. There’s just a trace of off white on top. Smell is of fresh apricots and faint lactobacillius. I’m tasting tart lactobacillius with a sweet apricot finishz. The mouth is dry, crisp, and refreshing.",4.34
4156,La Fosse,"I had this right after having Fuzzy at the tasting room in St. Louis and they are neck and neck. I may actually prefer La Fosse, because the apricots have a more unique aroma and tartness that set it apart from Fuzzy more significantly than anticipated.",4.83
4157,La Fosse,Slightly hazy unpolished gold with a fizzy white blanket settling to a thin spotty film.,3.94
4158,La Fosse,Had poured on-site at side project cellar from a 375ml bottle. Wow is it spectacular with a tart punch to the face that finishes smooth from the apricot. Very delightful mouth feel that makes this perfect for a summer day,4.68
4159,La Fosse,Blend #3.,4.42
4160,La Fosse,"Finally got to rate this beer. B3 from bottle to glass, pours an opaque orange hue, a lot like the juice. Very fruity on the nose. The flavor profile to me is very similar to Fuzzy(I guess I should have an actual peach and apricot side by side to really know the difference), which in the end is why I am rating it the same. Beautiful beer, that I think Side Project has improved over previous batches, as the acidity levels have gone down quite significantly in my opinion.",4.45
4161,La Fosse,"L: Bold tangerine and dark orange hues with a thin wispy white head that recedes quickly
S: Ripe juicy apricot with a complement of other citrus and stone fruits and slight hay funk
T: Healthy shot of tart grapefruit followed by a burst of muddled peaches; the finish is a robust funky apricot note that lingers
F: Medium bodied with light carb; rich and jammy
O: For a four-year-old bottle of blend #1 this has held up surprisingly well. The carb and head have fallen off slightly, but what's left is a concentrated wild apricot jammy experience. Another incredible fruited sour by one of the best in the game - well done.",4.59
4162,La Fosse,Batch 2 bottle poured into a Side Project wine glass.,4.77
4163,La Fosse,"Blend 2, consumed onsite at Side Project. Juicy apricots with a touch of oak and the signature Side Project yeast/sourness. Looks and smells incredible...very nicely done!",4.73
4164,La Fosse,"i am surprised to learn this is the same base beer as fuzzy, which to me wasnt anywhere near this sour, this beer seems way more acidic to me, but maybe thats the impact of the different fruits on it or of its relative maturity, i really dont know. either way, this is up there with the very best beers i have had from side project to date. pale hazy lambic looking beer, with a fizzy white head that dissipates fast. the aroma is the best part for me, woody bretty funk with citrusy bacterial tang over a pale wheaty base, it is lambic at its core it seems, but the fruit is so vibrant here, soft super ripe apricots, their absolute essence, intense and amazingly enticing. sometimes apricots and peaches can be a little samey in beers, depending on how they are used, but there is no mistaking these apricots! so true to the real fruit, in its best form. the flavor is like that too, with a lot of the sourness and wild yeast flavor (and wood) on the front end, and all the fruit showing up later on. i like the progression of flavors moving this way, the fruit lingers long in the finish, but the beer is very dry. its a step more sour than it needs to be i think, it sort of hurts the teeth like that, has an overdeveloped bacterial sting, and sits litle vinegary in the belly. still nice bretty notes about, as fruity as the apricots themselves. great carbonation and a very light body. a very special beer, and perhaps as good an apricot wild beer as has been made in the states...",4.39
4165,La Fosse,batch 2 drank at side project on 3/28/2016,4.58
4166,La Fosse,"Batch2 from the bottle release today. Look is opaque light orange. Smell is light funk at first, eggy, then heavy apricots as it warms. Taste is amazing. Sour then apricots all over the place. More apricots as it warms up. Dry finish. Wife and I have had almost all of the fruited sours and this is by far the best we've ever had from Side Project. They really hit the nail on the head with this one. This beer explodes apricots all over the place. Really really tasty.",4.75
4167,La Fosse,"Had at CBC 2016. I love sour beers, and there were some great ones there. This one was simply too much though; everything that would probably make this beer great as well gets overshadowed by the extreme sourness. Without a doubt the most sour beer I've ever had. As a bit of a novelty , definitely worth trying. But man, my teeth hated me after this one.",3.83
4168,La Fosse,"A: Rich golden orange but has no head or carb to speak of
S: lots of ripe apricot with an intense acetic smell, you can tell this is going to be sour
T: apricot, funk, cottage cheese, yogurt, highly lacto and acidic
M: very dry but doesn't feel undercarbed
O: the apricots are here but overcome bu the enamel ripping sourness and acidity. My gut will be feeling this one in the morning.",3.87
4169,La Fosse,"First SP fruited beer. La Fosse is fine, pretty good even, but it suffers from the overwhelming amount of acidity (reminded me of Upland). I definitely don't think it's worth what it trades for. If you want Apricots, I think nearly every other similar beer is much better (Aurelian Lure, Apricot Bu, Apricot Fruit Stand, Fou Foune, West Ashley, etc).",4.25
4170,La Fosse,This is straight battery acid. Batch one and batch two are just straight acid. Batch one was even more so than batch two. This is easily the worst side project beer I've had to date. This will be a preference thing though. Both of my friends liked it while I poured the rest of mine in their glasses,3.24
4171,La Fosse,"This beer definitely has apricot in it. The smell is there and the taste is there along with some punch you in the face sourness. This beer is very acidic and funky and plays well with the fruit. Did a side by side with Map of the Sun and de Garde's Imperial Apricot and this came in 2nd to DG, Map came in a distant 3rd.",4.11
4172,La Fosse,The beer pours a golden yellow with minimal head.,4.5
4173,La Fosse,"375 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Very hazy orange body. Small white head. Strong apricot aroma. Oak. White wine. And immediately the taste is incredibly sour. The sourest apricots I can imagine. Overwhelming. Really great apricot flavor, but it just gets so sour. Just a bit of oak and white wine remain. Low carbonation. It’s good, but so sour. Completely covers up anything else going on.",3.34
4174,La Fosse,Lots of apricot with a moderate funk to the aroma. Sweet apricots mix with funky and musty sourness in the taste. A little sharp in the finish. Excellent overall.,4.46
4175,La Fosse,"The beer is an orange juice gold color. Smallish white head. Very cloudy. Head dissipates quickly. The aroma is big on apricots. Pretty good lacto note. Not much funk. Quite a nice juicy fruit aroma. The taste is very sour. You get some nice fruit but the acidity is just too aggressive for me. There seems to be a nice beer hidden underneath that monster sour kick, and it's a real shame that you can't really taste it well. Some oak - a bit of a buttery white wine flavor - and apricots come through, but both are well in the background. Mostly lacto sourness, mostly just tastes like neutral acidity. Big pucker. Lots of back of the throat sour, phlegmy feeling in the finish. Fairly light body. As I wrote before, there's a good beer in there, but it's so sour that you lose complexity and depth of flavor.",3.52
4176,La Fosse,"Pours a fantastic golden yellow, similar to the color on the label. Nose is full of sour and some peachy fruitiness gently in the background.
The sour comes at you hard upon first taste, overtaking your palate. Thankfully loads of apricots follow up the sourness and blend nicely. The feel is thicker then I was expecting and it was necessary to offset the sour. Really nice and long finish.",4.47
4177,La Fosse,"Imcredible beer. Only had a small 3 oz sample at the FWIBF into a 6 oz snifter. The stone fruit shines and is comimented nicely with the puckering sour of the lactic acid. For a Side Project, these brews continue to take on starring roles!",4.99
4178,La Fosse,A. Cloudy golden orange in color. Thin ring of white foam and minimal lacing.,4.56
4179,La Fosse,"Undrinkable due to the acidity. Had higher hopes for this one but it was a drain pour for me. Maybe a bad bottle, but see others with similar comments.",3.41

750 ml bottle, batch 24 5/20, poured into an Ourison glass",4.52
4183,Saison Bernice,"Bottled May, 2020. Poured relatively conservatively into a standard pint glass. Attractive hazy yellow color with a medium amount of fluffy white head, a thin layer of which lingers for some time. Tons of lacing, which is unusual, at least for the saisons / farmhouse ales I typically drink. Definitely picking up the sour on the nose, although it's not overwhelming. Taste is pleasantly tart and just the tiniest bit of funk in the aftertaste. Feel is pillowy soft and smooth. Less carbonation than I expected based on the effervescence that was present upon opening the bottle. This is a very well done saison.",4.44
4184,Saison Bernice,No bottling date visible; consumed on 5/2/20,4.4
4185,Saison Bernice,"First pour from the 750ml bottle is clear golden yellow with bubbling effervescence and a nice foamy white head even after several years aging in the bottle. Further pours produce a hazy cloudy appearance. The aroma is clean with light banana, hay, straw, honey, lemon, apricot, apple, pear, vanilla, doughy bready malt, some barnyard funk, horse blanket, hints of clove spice, peppercorn, apple cider, and floral earthy hops. Tastes tart, slightly sour and vinegary with apple cider notes, lemon, apricot, apple, pear, banana, hay, straw, honey, vanilla, clove, peppercorn medley, horse blanket, barnyardy funk, bready doughy malt, and floral earthy hops. Feels medium bodied, smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a really great and complex saison.",4.71

4187,Saison Bernice,"On draft at brewery.
Golden slightly dark yellow. Minimal head with lacing.
Bretty tart oaky nose.
Tastes very similar to west Ashley and other fruited sours. Definite tart peach or apricot notes. Checked with bartender. No fruit is on here.
Textbook saison body and dry tart finish.
Very nice. Not over the top.",4.26
4188,Saison Bernice,Huge thanks to Steve for this one. This has been on my radar for quite some time.,4.41
4189,Saison Bernice,"I thought this beer was fantastic.
I did think that the overall acidity was a little more than what I wanted from a ""Saison""/ farmhouse ale but nonetheless, very good.
Cheers to Tim and Adair!",4.69
4190,Saison Bernice,May be one of my favorites of all time. Lucky enough to have two bottles of this on two separate occasions while in Berlin. Muted Horn has an outstanding selection and partnerships with some of the best around the world. Must try/bucket list. I am not a fan of Brett but this beer is unreal.,5
4191,Saison Bernice,"Much thanks to John for sending me on my way with this in tow. I can't find any date info on the bottle itself, but I want to say he told me it was a 2016? I could well be making that up, but that's the year that sticks in my mind for whatever reason. It's somewhere between batch 5 and 15 as best as I can sleuth up. Yeah, narrows it down a lot...",4.23
4192,Saison Bernice,Appearance - pours super clear golden color with a nice fluffy white head great retention. Few spotty sheets of lacing.,4.78

4194,Saison Bernice,"Tasted from bottle. Classic farmhouse saison. Pours a hazy gold. Fruity and funky aroma. Crisp, light, refreshing mouthfeel. Flavors of citrus fruit, farmhouse funk and some grassy earthy flavors. Excellent.",4.44
4195,Saison Bernice,As a New Englander who has been to Vermont several times...I can't help but make the comparison (which I feel is apt) to Hill Farmstead's lovely array of farmhouse ales.,4.39
4196,Saison Bernice,"Poured a bright hazy yellow color with a fragile foamy white head that disappeared quickly. There were extravagant aromas of Brett, white grapes, subtle citrus, with yeasty overtones. Very fruity and aromatic. The flavors are likewise the same, very fruity with yeasty overtones. Plenty of white grapes around the mouth with some Brett and subtle citrus and perhaps pitted fruit. The flavors come without any restraint. Its like opening up this bottle released its potency. The mouthfeel was not harsh, it was quit pleasant, smooth, and light bodied. Overall exceptional beer, the flavors where spot on, again extravagant without being overwhelming. I could drink this again and again if I only I had easy access to this beer.",4.43
4197,Saison Bernice,"Holy crap is this rated high, I had no idea. Well its time then. Pours a cloudy yellow with 1/2"" white head. This review is from a sample on tap at the Bistro barrel aged festival. Dry yeast brett nose to it. Light. When you talk rustic agricultural stuff, here it is, plenty of leather meets wood meets hay meets various barnyard effects here. This is what its all about. Layers of aromas.",4
4198,Saison Bernice,"Sadly, I neglected to note the batch number - I shared this bottle with friends and bar staff at Barrel Theory in St. Paul. The bottle gushed every so slightly, but showed no signs of being infected. The nose is lightly sour, while the taste is light, mildly sour, yeasty, clean, and very drinkable. It's a beautiful gold-yellow in color with a light, crisp head. I wish I'd drank this by myself - it's a delicious beer!",4.48
4199,Saison Bernice,"Pours a clouded golden yellow with a medium sized sized, spongy head.",3.83
4200,Saison Bernice,"I received this from @bum4ever in an LIF box. Poured from 750 ml bottle into tulip glass. It pours a cloudy, golden-honey color with nearly a finger of foamy, eggshell-colored head and creamy lacing with long retention. The tiny bubbles ascend continuously. It's a lovely pour. It has a fragrant, sour aroma with lemon peel, banana, coriander, clove, and funky yeast. It's absolutely delicious with the sour fruit complimented by a touch of sweet banana and apple as the glass warms. The balance of sour, sweet, and spice is terrific and there is a touch of pepper at the finish. The mouth feel is wonderful: despite the lively carbonation it's remarkably creamy and viscous. Overall, this may be the best Saison I've had the pleasure to drink. The flavors are bold and the feel is as good as it gets. What a privilege to drink this wonderful beer!",4.53
4201,Saison Bernice,Cloudy straw appearance with slight white head and carbination. Fruity aroma. Taste is a dry tart with fruity accent that is not too harsh. A pleasant saison.,4.25
4202,Saison Bernice,750mL bottle from j47paco (thanks again!). No discernible bottling information. Served in an oversized Bruery snifter.,4.34

4204,Saison Bernice,"Poured out a golden-yellow color with some haze and a small white head. It smelled of lemon, acidity and white wine-like notes. Some sweet caramel, tart and acidic lemon flavors. Crisp and sharp.",4.5
4205,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Boom! Boom! Boom! Like Northeudge in ‘94 or Tupac shooting a music video, this one shakes, rattles, and rolls! This one is like Barry Bonds on roids…oh wait, he already was.",4.59
4206,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)...
L- Even rested/chilled it forms head really fast, so pour super-slow. Pours deep chestnut brown with slight haze and a mid-tan 6Cm head. There's fast rising CO2 micro-bubbles up the side of the nucleated glass. ps. Holds well and forms major lacing on the way down.
S- Strikingly deeply toasty and rich malts; it makes me imagine how a bag of ground up Maltesers might smell.
T- Again very malty, deep roasty, a notably fat but classy ABV% note crosses my palate, off into hops, then further rich malts and into a hoppier somewhat dry finish. Solid yet refined. Blimey, if you think this beer's reputation is hype, wait until you try it!
F- Rich deep roasty, the ABV% is clear enough it's similar to some liquor barrel aged beers.
O- I picked this one for my 1950th review (the WestV12 will mark B2k). I was conscious of the brewery's repute and hype surrounding it, the difficulty getting their beer etc etc. Would I be underwhelmed, would I be underwhelmed but feel somehow obliged to rate it high. No way at all, this is a seriously luscious beer. Now perhaps some people might not like the fact that a 'mere' 8% beer lets you get an ABV% zing from it - some regard this as unclassy - but it works well within the rather glorious whole for me.
I'd happily drink this again, hell-ya, just maybe not at the cost it is imported into the UK!

This is a very active beer in the glass. After 5 minutes, the head is still almost an inch thick and continues to be actively reinforced by the carbonation from below.

4212,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Bottle from Etre. Solid dark brown in color with great clarity and a frothy off white head that persists and leaves lots of sticky lace. Light skunk aroma when first opened but that dissipated quickly leaving rich toasty bready notes with lots of dark dried fruits. Flavor is rich and decadent yet soft and delicate with an abundance of carbonation that gives a bit of a bubbly mouthfeel; light alcohol presence. Has a medium body with a bit of a drying finish that leaves just a hint of sweet caramelized malt on the palette. Spectacular beer! The 12 gets all the hype, but this one might be even better.

Like the XII it will bottle age and mature the flavor, in some ways making it less heavy. What I like about this beer is the fruity notes in both the aroma and flavor where the hops are noticeably only in reducing the sweetness and leaving no bitterness. A highly recommended beer!",5
4216,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),Poured from a 330cl bottle into a Triple glass. Pours a lovely brown color with plenty of head. Smells really wonderful. Perhaps like a sweet pumpernickel bread?

The taste is roughly the same but a stronger and more bitter hop note with a light burnt Belgian sugar towards the end but ending with the hop note. There is a light toffee note with a bit of berry underneath all of the hop notes though it does get buried at times. One thing to note is that the notes change as the beer warms up. When it warms up, the hop notes recedes into the background a bit and brings forth the malt and toffee notes.
The feeling is pretty good. It has a nice silky and cream texture to it even thought it comes off as watery on and off. The carbonation is light and soft. There is a slight dryness in the finish.
Overall, this a pretty good beer and worth drinking. It's a simple beer that manages to be pretty good without having to turn into a Frankenstein's monster with different ingredients.",4.33
4219,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Drank at the source
Brown color with a thick thin beige head with short retention.
Aroma with notes of prunes, caramel, mild fresh floral hops, a bit of pine, nuts, and some chocolate.
Flavor with notes of floral and medicinal hops, some cocoa, mild candied sugar, prunes, pine, nuts, spices, wood, orange peel, coriander, berries, figs, vanilla and green pineapple. Dry aftertaste with a decent bitterness.
Medium body with somewhat effervescent carbonation. Alcohol of 8% is completely absent.
Aroma was a bit disappointing, but the mouth was quite nice given the fresh hops and complexity making this Dubbel as attractive as it can be. Sure, it does not compare to its big brother the 12th (unfair, different styles), but I had to keep raising the grade once it warmed up.",4.03
4220,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Eureka ! I finally found it !
But, a friend had to bring it back from his visit to Belgium.
Westvleteren's rarity in the U.S. is understood, and the privilege of having one is appreciated.",4.51

4222,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"From a bottle picked up in Belgium. Dark brown color with a thick layer of tan head. Smells of bready malts, caramel, and dried fruit.

4223,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"L-Dark brown body with beige foam with proper thickness, which is lovely at first glance.
S-Bready, Honey, dried fruits such as prune, cherry, raisins
T-Quite a bit of sweetness, but not clear as Westvleteren 12. Also can taste dried fruits.
F-Very foamy and smooth
O-Quite heavy I think, which is the type I like, but if you want more sweetness, try Westvleteren12",4.79
4224,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Moussy tan over oxblood; confectioners’ sugar, bright cherry, sarsaparilla, toffee, light clove, some banana + a touch of roses; cocoa, big black pepper, bread + butter pudding, marshmallow, prune, sticky toffee, + a bit of a floral end; smooth, moussy, medium.",4.41
4225,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Poured a brown body with khaki head and lace sheath down the glass. Aroma comes across as containing mild candi sugar/caramel (toffee?) malts sweetness, figs, raisins, other dark fruits like prunes, bread, and some floral hops. Smooth, creamy, the yeast keeps it smooth while the caramel/toffee(?)/(other) malts keep it sweet, yet you get the dark fruits, mainly some raisins and figs, along with some bread for filling body and the beer has great balance. Great beer, worth the hype, another Belgian that it is hard for me to even qualify and I'm glad I got the chance to try this beer.",4.37

S -- Brown bread, honey, banana, fig, prune, raisin, gingerbread, slightly oxidized herbal hops
T -- Largely follows the nose. A little bit of an almost saffron-like character, which is cool. The malts and yeast really work together nicely
F -- Medium mouthfeel, medium+ carb. Fluffy, soft mouthfeel and immensely drinkable
O -- Not quite of the caliber of Westy 12 but still damn good and a classic example of the style. Docking a quarter of a point for the high price point, even in Belgium",4.43
4228,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Aroma of tart cherries, spices (clove, something vaguely like gingerbread), lightly phenolic. Like sniffing a spicy holiday cake with some prunes or raisins baked in. Thin persistent off-white head, faint lacing. Colour is an opaque cola brown.",4.16
4229,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Right up front I get the classic dark fruits. Plum, raisin and fig with a touch of dark cherry. The malt has a deep earthy and somewhat nutty quality with a very mild molasses like sweetness and bitterness playing off each other. I also get a light note of black licorice and some bitter bakers chocolate moving into the finish. The finish has a firm earthy almost leathery hop bitterness with a warming Sherry or Madeira like alcohol character.",4.72

4244,DFPF,2016 (batch 1) drank on 2/4/2017,4.44
4245,DFPF,Bottle: Poured a copper/pink color beer with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of raspberry vinegar with some ripe mango notes is quite unique. Taste is also a mix of ripe fruit notes with some mango and other tropical fruit notes with some tart and raspberry vinegar notes. Body is full for style with good carbonation. Unique take on the style and something I wish I could drink again.,4.38
4246,DFPF,"Just gorgeous to look at - I almost didn't want to drink it. Like Miami Madness, it has a crazy low abv, so you can sip it all day long by the pool. DFPF >MM btw.",4.41
4247,DFPF,"now this is what i am talking about! this is how you use tropical fruit in a sour beer! splendid stuff, gives me a new respect for the brewery, and despite how the hype train rolls, i would drink this over their highly acclaimed maimi madness any day! brilliant fuschia pink color, not a ton of head, but electric, like some of the intense hibiscus beers out there, looks almost unnatural from the dragon fruit, but the aroma and flavor of both fruits is incredibly authentic. super fruit forward, the natural tartness of the passion fruit is a perfect addition to the already quite acidic and sour base beer, clean lemony lacto allowed to really develop. perfect ph for the fruit i think, max flavor extraction, a touch of sweetness, but i can still taste the wheat underneath it all. good carbonation, dramatic fruit flavors, just short of perfumey intense, concentrated, not for everyone i am sure. i loved how the fruits go together so well, and together with the sourness, awesome how low alcohol it is too! this is sensational beer that deserves the high praise it is receiving! nothing else like this exists to my knowledge. without question the best beer with dragon fruit i have ever had!",4.48
4248,DFPF,"This might be my favorite Berliner of all time. I managed to get 5 pours of this at GABF last weekend, and I would have gotten more if I had more time. This is insanely sour, fruity, and perfectly carbed.",4.78

4253,DFPF,The most beautiful purple pink I have ever seen. It looks like juice. Sparking with color. Rhubarb hue to it. Wow.,4.53
4254,DFPF,"The color, deep rich magenta, and the nose, total passion fruit bomb, were absolutely amazing! Taste was basically passion fruit juice without any detectable ""beer-ness"" other than carbonation, which left me somewhat undecided as part of me thinks a beer should taste a little like beer. That said, the usually enamel ripping sourness of de Garde Bu way down and you get JWB berliner, which to me sets THE high bar for all others.",4.55

4256,Bad Boy,"From a month-old pint can, pours a very clear deep orange-gold. Smell and taste are very herbal and piney, with a touch of citrus. Bracing bitterness, but not excessively so. A big, unapologetic West Coast IIPA. Fantastic beer.",4.5

4259,Bad Boy,"this is a beer i have been hearing about and reading about for what seems like forever, so it was awesome to finally get to try it, one of those beers of lore, always wondered how much better than everything else can something like this really be, and the answer is that it probably was considerably better than whatever anyone else was doing with this style when it was first introduced more than a decade ago. now, it kind of just seems like another one. thats not a knock against it of course, it was clearly a pioneering beer and more of a trend setter than these guys probably could have imagined, less clear than what was popular at the time, but certainly not hazy for the sake of it, although this could be credited at least partially with making room for such things. i love the hop complexion, i get the columbus way ahead of the galaxy, its so hoppy that i can almost taste the pellets, the greenness, the vegetal element not just the compounds we desire in the beer. its juicy and its kind of sweet from the pale barley malt too, but there is a lot of orange juice, grapefruit zest, and pine needle character here, very northwestern to me, slick and oily feeling and dense as can be, almost woody like lumber, and with a lot of body too, its a big one for sure, perfectly appropriately named. the bitterness is all after the swallow which is cool, its a long trajectory of flavors. citrus abounds as well later on, a honey taste and richness in the middle, and very good, although possibly not as well refined and distinctive as i thought it would be after all the hype over the years. i think, like pliny or something, that the rest of the field has caught up enough where this isnt as mindblowingly unique as it probably once was, but that does not diminish its excellence...",4.27
4260,Bad Boy,"Shared from a growler with Ryan. Pours a pretty hazy orange body. Fresh hops and piney resinous aromas, zesty citrus. On the tongue is delicate but flavorful west coast style zesty hops, piney and citrusy with a light bitterness on the finish. Moderate malt backbone. Smooth and easy, especially for 9%",4.25
4261,Bad Boy,"Parking lot share with George...pours a cloudy golden orange color. Nice and hazy! Aroma of pine, subtle citrus are abundant.

4265,Bad Boy,"One of the most wonderfully aromatic IPAs outside of the northeast! Alpine IPAs never fail to deliver, and this bad boy (ho!) is no exception! The bottle creeped me out a little bit, but I won't hold that against such a delicious DIPA.",4.54

4270,Bad Boy,"Crystal clear yellow with a dark white head. Dank hops, tropical fruit, with lingering citrus zest in the nose. Taste opens the citrus more, some honey now in play, super hoppy bitters and dankness, some stone fruit in the background. Feel is not as swirlingly complex as some other alpine ipas, but still has hop molding with a strong malt base.",4.59
4271,Bad Boy,"Dark ipa almost, dark orange and tan notes create an impressive head that holds its own for a few minutes. Aroma seemed to be somewhere along the lines of citra, summit, amarillo and simcoe.",4.49
4272,Bad Boy,"From a growler. Fresh fresh fresh! Hop aromas are pretty floral and fruit-forward. Plenty of biscuity grain detectable. Flavor is juicy citrus and melon fruits and some dank rosewater.

Right up there next to Enjoy By and Dinner.",4.87

4283,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,"Very dense hazy pour of pulpy orange juice hues. Rich and juicy tropical fruit aromas that rank with the best Other Half has to offer. Ripe melon, pulpy guava, pineapple and mango. The rich taste carries those hints and adds creamsicle and raw honey notes.

S: Aromas of tangerine, tutti-fruity, grapefruit, and caramel predominate with a very light pine and oregano notes.
T: Surprisingly dry, certainly at least semidry in my estimation. Flavor is cracker with fruitiness more in the lemon, lime, white grapefruit end of citrus, some very real and pronounced graininess (which adds), a vegetable piece (celery, oregano, daring I say cilantro) and a cumin-like bitterness that is really, really interesting.
M: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy, juicy, and luscious.

4302,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,"Recently canned, and it feels even better than the one I had in the brewery on tap a couple of weeks ago. And it was the same batch. For some reason, I think individual cans are generally better than keg.
Quite hazy orange and peach juice aspect with a thick head with medium retention and leaving laces.
Fresh tropical aroma to die for with notes of mango, tons of stone fruit, passion fruit, pine, fresh squeeze oranges, natural grapefruit and melon.
Flavor with notes of mango, pine resin, melon, white pepper, oat, faint but perceivable milk powder, grapefruit, pineapple, papaya, tangerine, onions, biscuit, lychees and guava. Dry aftertaste with a stronger bitterness that apparently feels. It made me sneeze after my first sip. Alcohol of 8.5% is very well disguised.
Medium velvety body with perfect carbonation.
Delicious DIPA with beyond expected tropical notes and green dank resins. Great complexity and wide range of flavors matched perfectly. At some point, I had to stop to further look for flavors. This has sat for 2 weeks and it sure better than the one I had from the same batch on tap in the brewery. I am start to think that we should drink the style fresh, but not that fresh.",4.46

Carb is light and the mouth feel is very pleasant - just a bit creamy, quite rich, and the finish is decently clean.

4305,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"poured a turbid murky orange color - is very reminiscent of OJ. Nose smells of OJ/citrus with a honey sweetness and a mild bitterness on the end. taste follows the nose, sweet citrus, followed by some bitterness but ends with hop burn/resin that remains for a bit - the can was rolled before opening. Feel is viscous and think for an IIPA, but has very good carb. Overall, this smells incredible and initial good taste, but the hop burn overtakes the palate. Maybe the hops need to dye down some - but this can is around a month old at this point. Have two other cans, and will open in increments over the next month. Will update if the taste increase.",4.01

The honey isn't really present here on the nose, but on the palate, it's there in spades at the end and finish, for sure. It's a wonderful mild honey sweetness that lingers for a while. Mild-moderate spicy bitterness, otherwise big but relatively balanced galaxy and caramel malt. This is pretty delicious, and the honeyed finish is really, really very nice.

F - Medium body and carbonation with a little prickliness on the finish.
O - Excellent double IPA.",4.31
4312,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"Pours like orange juice with a finger of white head.
Smells sweet, honey, citrus, a bit of bubblegum, light pine.
Taste starts with the resinous pine, turns to sweet fruits, peachy, honey, faint bubblegum notes linger.
Medium to full body, smooth, amply carbed.
Overall a great beer!",4.34

4315,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"One of the rare reviews I'll do, NOT from stream-of-consciousness, but rather from notes I wrote down. I drank this can in the mountains a few hours ago, in silence, save for the rushing river next to me. An experience.",4.48
4316,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,Galaxy is not one of my favorite hops - I'll be honest and just throw that out there.,4.6
4317,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"This beer is a beautiful expression of galaxy which I’ll admit I’m a galaxy fanboy. This is so tasty and the honey only smoothing out the edges of the pine and sweet resin from the galaxy makes it even better. Perfect execution. The only tweak I would make to make it my number 1 beer ever (beats is infinite by monkish, a DDH All galaxy imperial IPA) would be to double dry hop this beer with more galaxy to bring out that grapefruit and grassy taste to the next level. Phenomenal. Best trilltive ever and it’s not close.",4.78
4318,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"Creamy-looking dark OJ color with a thin finger of off-white head. Nice lacing. Huge aroma of weed, earthy smoked herbs and nuts. They carry over the taste, coupled with orange juice, lime, pithy and piney bitterness and a peppery alcohol bite. Some hop bite, too. Full bodied with a prickly feel. There’s a lot of depth and ton of alcohol in this one, but the nutty, smokey quality when fresh isn’t to my preference. I am interested to see how it changes with some age.",4
4319,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"08/2016 - While I enjoy the base beer, the Galaxy usage is top notch in my opinion. That said, the honey does a nice job balancing the Galaxy; tasty, refreshing, and super flavorful.",4.46
4320,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"Had on tap at the Trillium Garden on the Greenway a month or so back. Super hazy and golden color. Huge flavors of peach, citrus rind, honey, and resin attack the palate. It's very chewy and sticky in the mouth, a bit heavy in the stomach but still so very drinkable due to the flavor. This beer is incredible and the blend of wildflower honey with Galaxy was near perfect.",4.5
4321,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,Can. White head. Super hazy golden sunset orange. Looks like juice.,4.7
4322,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"One of the best IPAs I’ve had. Would put this just below Perm 32 for me. I remember having Mosaic Cutting Tiles last year, and thought it was a mess. The new fermentation for these beers not only makes the hop flavors pop, but also smooths them out and they look great in the glass. Really, this is possibly the best looking IPA I’ve had. It’s looks like a puree of pineapples and oranges, and has a thick, sticky head. The taste is like 32, but a little more bite that I really liked. They’re knocking these beers out of the park lately.",4.71
4323,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"Pours a very hazy, cloudy orange body with a two finger white head that reduces to a layer and leaves spotty lacing.",4.58
4324,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"Dated 5/18/18 on the bottom of the can, one week since brewing.",4.63
4325,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"This beer has the beautiful yellow appearance of egg whites, which might be tacky if it weren't backed up by an excellent smell of citrus and peach and a delectable taste of tangerines and brown sugar. Trillium is on one with this masterpiece, which has a texture that feels thick, bites nicely, and finishes crisp. This is one of the best, and I'm very happy to be moving to Boston next year in large part of the guys at Trillium.",4.57
4326,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"I CANsider myself very fortunate to have been the lucky winner of a buncha CANs in a recent lottery on a different social media site. I merely had to pony up the cost of shipping, which was modest, in return for a buncha CANs for The CANQuest (tm)! I had heard of & was certainly aware of Trillium B.C., but I have not been trading in a while & so I did not give them much thought. I am now interested in drinking & reviewing the entire Small Bird Series, especially Pipsqueak Penguin & Stumpy Duck since I have an affinity for the former & a rubber form of the latter who oversees my drinking & will be in an NBS pic later.",4.01

4329,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,"Pours a golden hazy orange with a two finger head, quickly dissipating. Smells of peppery hops, stone, earthy, with citrus. Taste is a bitter bite into tropical fruit, juicy and sharp. Lingering bitterness on the end, little bit of booze burn. Mouthfeel is nice and chewy. Not getting much of the honey. This is likely my favorite of the cutting tiles hop varieties. Good beer.",4.19
4330,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,Really enjoying this. Much less sweet than anticipated and has a nice chally bakers chocolage predominace. The apple brandy tastes genuine and natural whereas I feel I lot of prairies beers are try hard and artificial. Namely vanilla noir which is awfully fake.,4.5
4331,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,This rating is based on the original from a few years ago. Pours dark brown/black with exceptional thickness. The Apple Brandy melds perfectly to make this an exceptional barrel aged stout. For a number of years this was my favorite beer.,4.79
4332,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"I have never really been a fan of the apple brandy BA stouts. The apple character has always been an odd mix for me. I got this bottle for retail on the shelf mostly because I love Prairie and I knew people flip for this beer. Upon opening it, the smell is very distinct and I just don't like it! It smells the way it's supposed to smell, it's just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me. Now on the tongue, it's a completely different story for me. The apple is there but distinct and really appealing. A tiny bit tart? The stout's sweetness works well with this barrel. It also helps for it to be a bit warmer too. A great beer that changed my mind. I've never had a beer with a smell that I didn't like end up being enjoyable before, so a really fun beer.",4.58
4333,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,I’ve had a majority of the highest rated/reviewed Prairie Stouts. Probably all of them in the top 250. This is easily the best one of the bunch. Everything is superb!,4.65
4334,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"A spectacular stout; as the previous reviewers explain the taste follows the nose - apples, malty, boozy.
You MUST let this warm to experience the full flavor profile.",4.45
4335,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,Pours a Pitch black no head or lacing. 4 oz pour. Apple brandy aroma. Very mild roasting. More roasting on taste. Heavy on the brandy. Apple on the end. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.,4.03
4336,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"A beer that lives up to the reputation. I’ll get to the appearance at the end of the review, mostly because the smell and taste are the two most important parts of this beer and for one other reason. Smell is boozy barrel up front with a healthy amount of warm apple to round it out. Taste is more balanced, with the apple slightly leading the way and the boozy oaky barrel subtly surrounding it. Feel is medium bodied, neither oily nor thick-a perfect example of “just right”. Mouth watering, drinks more like a non-barrel aged 9 or 10% abv than a big bold 12.",4.76
4337,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Opaque dark brown with a thin tan head.
Aroma: chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and subtle apple brandy. Really nice.
Taste: followed the nose. Great balance between the stout flavors, barrel, and apple brandy. Delicious.
Feel: full bodied but not overly sweet.
Overall: world class. Lived up to expectations.",4.47
4338,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"12 oz, bottle purchased in OK. Poured into Kane chalice and allowed to warm.",4.4
4339,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"L: Poured from a bottle to a snifter glass. Had a jet black color and a thick, opaque consistency. There was a quarter inch of foamy, tan-colored head that quickly dissipated. Average lacing.",4.49
4340,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"L — 1,000 lumens passed through the glass reveals a fairly dark black body. Lovely deep brown head that dissipates quite quickly
S — Apple brandy, molasses, hot booziness, dark chocolate, hint of roast, caramel
T — Dark chocolate, brandy, oak, molasses, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, roast, faint char
F — Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. Quite easy drinking for the ABV, the apple character from the brandy really helps here
O — Nice offering from Prairie. Still like Bomb more but this is very good. Very pricey @ $14/12 oz bottle",4.24
4341,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Black pour at 55 degrees with no ruby edges; quick cap of fizzy bubbles. Aroma of apple cider; brandy liqueur retro nasal. Apple jack, red wine, semi sweet malt base; some chocolate; green apples finish. Medium body, moderate carbonation; very light warmth despite 12% ABV. World class, so we’ll balanced and so dangerous; brandy/barrel notes are off-set by gobs of ripe apples from nose to sip through the finish; impressive!",4.71
4342,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Disappointed. The apple brandy didn't work for me with this dark base stout. It was also pretty thin in mouthfeel especially for this brand. I much prefer Bomb!, Pirate Bomb!, or Birthday Bomb! to this one.",3.68
4343,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Pours dark black with a small beige head that fades quickly. The aroma has apple brandy, dark chocolate, cocoa, and dark roasted malt. Tastes like it smells. Sweet taste. Not much of th dark roasted malt comes through, so there is no balancing bitterness. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. A very drinkable beer. I love the Apple Brandy barrel. It is a nice change of pace.",4.43
4344,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"In my teku it is a very dark brown with a half-inch, quickly dissipating, tan head.
Aroma of booze, sweet fruit, and chocolate.
Apple brandy taste, with some chocolate.
Very smooth. The brandy is quite noticeable, but complimented by the chocolate. I would drink this at room temperature, or near it, to fully appreciated the beer.",4.41
4345,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Prairie Apple Brandy Barrel Noir, 12% ABV. Pours black with the typical Prairie ring of brown bubbles. Nose is apple brandy, taste follows and as it reaches 55 degrees F the chocolate shows up. Excellent mouthfeel, though a touch watery, still overall outstanding. I'd advise just drinking this at room temperature.",4.1
4346,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"For goodness sake, let this warm up to near room temperature. Otherwise, it's a dull, muted brandy barrelled beer. Around 60-65 degrees F, it emerges into a chocolate fondue apple of a stout, still of only modest complexity, but definitely bolder and more appealing.",4.31
4347,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"I had the original by the tulsa boys. I thought and still think it’s the best beer I ever had. This new one is a let down. First smell was that apple juice dominated over everything else. That was odd and off putting compared to the original. First taste was rewarding that it seemed balanced like the original. Then the big let down came into play. The mouth drenching aftertaste of apple juice plagued my mouth. This is not a barreled apple brandy. If it is it is way over powering of the bomb like base that seems balanced at first. The actual brandy alcohol seems even lost to me from the apple domination. Is this a bad beer? No. Is this the best beer I ever had ? No. I even doubt the 12% abv and would rate lower around 10%. I took no measurements though. It’s just not as rich and balanced as the original, plain and simple. Considering this is my favorite beer ever. Please try again. I will applaud the extra effort.",3.12
4348,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"This is my first AB beer and man I'm enjoying it!
Pours black as can be with a thin khaki head.
Smell is amazing! Green apple, barrel, dark fruit, caramel.
Taste is quite nice too! The green apple leads the way, charred oak, raisin, caramel, dark roasted malts. A bit sweet on the finish.
Nice slick almost syrupy feel. Very smooth, low alcohol presence.
Overall a fantastic beer that I was thankful to have tried.",4.56

4351,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Vintage: 2015
Poured from bottle into tulip, good 1 finger dark tan head, good retention and lacing. Jet black in the glass, no light gets thru. Smells of chocolate, caramel, vanilla, roasted malt and slight hint of apple, not much. Taste is deep roasted malt, and chocolate, very rich. There is vanilla, caramel, and some apple coming thru in the middle. The end has a slight mouth numbing alcohol finish, not hot, just warming. Mouthfeel is wonderful, great beer, great sipping beer. I want to kick myself for not grabbing more of this when I had a chance. I think I still have a 2016 in my cellar. Looking forward to it.
One thing to note, as the beer warms (started it at 48) that numbing alcohol finish turns into a lingering taste of apple brandy. Man this beer is special",4.53

I've had about 8 other Other Halfs. Those other 8… average. No need as far as I'm concerned to get into the details, just head into these giant ratings with a bit of skepticism. It seems like if the ABV is high enough, the rating is less stringent. I mean this beer is fine. It's not objectionable in any way, but it's just an average higher-ABV DDH sweet Hazy NEIPA. Add it to the pile. Don't give it a 99. My can was less than a month old, so it's fresh.",3.5

Smooth, velvety, nice amount of carbonation. Overall, excellent beer!",4.23
4360,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,"16oz can from Tavour. Hazy yellow body with a small, frothy white head. Aroma is a blend of floral and yeasty notes, soft, welcoming.

Exquisite.",4.41

4363,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,"Pours a deep golden hazy with good white head retention. Three's a menthol aroma. It's bubblegummy, chewy mouthfeel, some tangy citrus that turns into peanut. That galaxy note really is what robs this of being a really solid beer. It's very dry too so it leans heavily on its dankness. I do think it would benefit from a little more sugar to bring out the tropical hop character, but there's nothing that can save you from bad Galaxy hops.",3.69
4364,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,"Can dated 9 June, 2021. Nice pale orange hue with a frothy head, plenty of haze. The is a glorious dankness to this nose - full of pine and funk and juicy tropical fruit. That all gets amplified in the palate. Crushable fruit from the islands - all good and ripe: pineapple, mango, banana, guava and the addition of tangy citrus. The hoppiness is well supported in this too. Just a lovely output.",4.56
4365,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,"Can dated 4/14/21 into pint glass. Pours a very hazy golden orange with a nice off-white head. Good lacing. Initial impression is pineapple, mango, a bit of grassiness, pine resin, and a very subtle sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium and chewy; carbonation is perfect. Finish is more citrus and pine, fading to a slight but enjoyable bitterness. Overall, one of Other Half's better offerings IMHO.",4.54

4367,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,"Canned 4-14-21, enjoyed on 5-10-21. Glowing rich orange color, 1 finger head dissipates to a ring. Aromas of pineapple, white grape, peach, yeasty, earthy, fresh biscuit- not spectacular on the nose, but a good representation of what's to come. On a small sip its nothing special, on a big sip its showing its class. Well rounded and dynamic flavor profile. Medium-low thickness for style, but also toes the sweetness line very well- a good show from the doughy, confectionary, crispy malt profile. If there's any bitterness it shows up in a fresh grassy quality that grows as the beer warms. Fruit flavor is green melon and pithy + the expected pineapple, stone fruit, floral. It's a very good beer but not the best DNEIPA I've had recently- I'm sure it pops a little more when fresher than this. Upstaged locally in Michigan by HOMES and WaxWings.",4.28
4368,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,"Look...The usual excellence of a NEDIPA. Yellowish murky, frothy carbonation
Smell...NYC tap water? No really puff of yeasty pineapple and hops. Mango citrus earthy
Taste...unique pithiness following the nose. A path forward leading you to mango, pineapple yeasty smell. Earth citrus texture i really like.
Feel..well executed for the style. not pulpy. fullness and slippery enough to ensure drinkagulpability.

Aroma is nice, the brew smells like mango, pineapple, bready malt, orange, tropical fruit, grassiness, pine and vanilla. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some white pepper, peaches, grapefruit, herbal and honeydew melon flavors. There's a lot going on with this brew, seems like I pick up another flavor with each few sips. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and a bit creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation.

The taste has that same grapefruit taste up front that fades into a nice and caramelly malt with a satisfying just barely bitter finish. This one is sweeter than expected, but the honey really does compliment the malt flavor. It's slightly more carbonated than expected, so it's almost refreshing, and goes down very easily. Overall a good DIPA but I wouldn't say it's one of the best.",4.03

4383,Hopslam Ale,"Although previously consumed a review hasn't yet been posted. So, this time, a twelve ounce brown bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass. It looks good, but not inspiring. The color is a bright and light copper-amber, on the translucent side. There's only a slight head and no glass lacing. The aroma begins to improve expectations, as there's malt, hops and even honey to detect. The taste starts with a good full on earthy malt character. This never gets bitter, but it never gets too sweet. The body is near perfect and the balance of malt to hop is unassailable. That must be quite the accomplishment, since honey is in the mix. A wonderful exchange of sweeter malt and mild hops that 0deliveres a tasteful brew that may disguise its high ABV better than any other. Outstanding.",4.35
4384,Hopslam Ale,Pours a hazy orange. Full hop aroma. A explosion,4.5
4385,Hopslam Ale,Anytime I get a chance to buy hopslam I immediately stock up on it. The high alcohol taste is masked by the smooth bitterness. The taste isn't completely overwhelming and goes down smooth.,4.88

This is a fine effort by the Bell’s brew meisters, enjoy.",4.38

It knocked my sox off it tasted so good; smells just slightly like an IPA, faintly hoppy; Ooh, the taste. It's unusual, and very pleasant; The mouthfeel is just right, perfect. It feels like beer. After two sips, this may be my new favorite beer. Well, later sips were a little less spectacular. We'll have to see if it becomes a favorite. I expect there may be more of it, but at $21.49 a six, probably not all that often.",4.09
4398,Hopslam Ale,"Clear brass, white head, retention is somewhat lacking, spotty lace.

4399,Hopslam Ale,"It’s good, there’s no doubt about it. I avoided trying the 2021 issue because of all the hype around it and the ridiculous price. At 15 dollars a six pack, I won’t be trying it again. It’s blended well, all the flavors come together nicely. The bitterness is there and satisfying. But, from one beer lover to the next, this is an overpriced hype machine. I’ve had dozens of DIPA, many of them were at least as good as this one.

O: I’ve had a LOT of dipas and this one hits the perfect balance. Wow! You see it you buy it!",4.93
4401,Hopslam Ale,"Tried this for the first time last year, but my review was deleted by *someone*? Nothing to compare this to, but if it's half as good as the last, then I am excited! Let's do.",4.08
4402,Hopslam Ale,"Enjoyed on tap at Flying Saucer which is Memphis TN.
A: Pours a dark gold copper color. Clear with no haze. Still about a half inch of foam after the waitress and brought it to the table, from that I judge the retention time to be fairly good.
S: Smells very hoppy with scents of caramel and a sweet honey fragrance.
T: bold hop flavor really smacks the tastes buds (pun intended). Malt tastes of caramel and gives the aftertaste a bit of sweetness which balances out the bitterness on the front end. The abv is very well hidden and not noticeable.
F: Great feel, not too light or heavy. The right amount of body and carbonation.
O: Fantastic! One of the best IPAs I have enjoyed. The bitter and hop flavor is wonderful, but the malt makes it a well balanced beer with a complex flavor.",4.67
4403,Hopslam Ale,12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a fairly clear orange copper in color with a thin cap of off white foam. Fair retention though settling to some spottiness.,3.62
4404,Hopslam Ale,"Hopslam is yet another classic Bell's top-of-the-line brews. The sweetness in this beer is reminiscent of a DIPA, but with the unique flavor of honey quickly usurped by the lingering hops. Worth a buy each year!",4.62
4405,Hold On To Sunshine,"A very rich beer. Pours black as motor oil, about the same consistency as well. A finger of dark brown head reducing to a ring of bubbles, leaving no lacing. Nose is peanut butter, chocolate, roasted coffee and molasses. Taste follows suit with peanut butter upfront and the rest taking a back seat. Very decadent beer but not overwhelming. Feel is full, creamy, and thick. I liked it and would drink more.",3.92
4406,Hold On To Sunshine,Sweet and smooth. Dark pour. Loads of fresh-roast coffee on the nose. Dark chocolate on the tongue. An amazing beer!,4.79
4407,Hold On To Sunshine,"Pours very dark, pretty viscous, decent mocha head that slowly fades. Huge peanut butter aroma mixes with minimal chocolate. Very nice peanut flavor, light chocolate, espresso rounds off the finish with a light bitterness. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall a very tasty imperial pastry stout, love the low 7.6 ABV.",4.5
4408,Hold On To Sunshine,Pours a deep onyx. Nice peanut butter aroma. Taste of perfect combination of peanut butter and chocolate. One doesn’t overpower the other. Smooth palate coating mouthfeel. Definite winner from Treehouse. The 7.6% abv a bonus.,4.83
4409,Hold On To Sunshine,"Pours a dark black. Aroma is predominantly roasted peanut butter along with chocolate and coffee. Taste is combination of the aroma but the chocolate is the more dominant taste with the roasted peanut butter was close second. Mouthfeel was light, smooth & creamy. Exceptional stout.",4.6

4411,Hold On To Sunshine,"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a Tree House snifter glass; canned on 11/20/20, code I'M FEELING HOTS HOTS,HOTS.
A: Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a less than one finger, light brown head, low retention, and sudsy lacing.
S: Aromas of chocolate malted, cherry, plum peel, peanut, and ?maple.
T: Very sweet with lactose flavor unquestionably an element. Flavors largely reflective of the nose; somewhere between a Hershey's® bar and chocolate soda with a brief pit stop at pure cane sugar. Bitterness sufficient to keep the sweetness from becoming cloying. Nutty, but no hint of coffee on the nose or palate.
M: Full bodied with moderate effervescence. Rich and tangy.
O: Full disclosure, I am a dry stout enthusiast and milk stouts are not typically my favorites, but I could see this being served in lieu of dessert.",4.2
4412,Hold On To Sunshine,I like it as a PB stout...definitely one of the better tasting substyle of milk/sweet stout. As a milk/sweet stout it does a good job as well. It's hard not to just C+P my review of Gunner's Daughter here because I think the two beers are that similar except for a couple alcohol percentage points and slightly thicker feel from HOTS.,4.31

4414,Hold On To Sunshine,"Can dated 9/16/20, poured into a snifter glass. Mocha color, attractive head that quickly dissipated, leaving lots of lacing. Chocolate, peanut butter, coffee smell. Tastes like a Reese’s peanut butter cup dunked in coffee. Nice, lingering finish with carbonation. Not overly sweet. Nicely done. Would buy this again.",4.5
4415,Hold On To Sunshine,16oz can (packaged 6/25/20) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a solid black color with 1/4 inch of brown head that dissipated almost immediately and left no lacing.,2.84
4416,Hold On To Sunshine,"We opened this can last night, with temps in the 60s, the kids tending to the fire pit, and the air crisp. We threw around some slices with IPAs earlier, then settled next to the fire to roast marshmallows and sip this stout. It poured a dark wood charcoal color, with hints of amber around the edges. The head made a brief presence then ebbed away. The aroma wafts out of the tulip glass with delectable coffee and chocolate notes; “pass just the marshmallows please, I have all the chocolate I need.” The stout swirls deliciously and the milky sweetness combines with the carbonation to give it an ice cream float profile to the taste. When treehouse says coffee, they mean it! What a treat!",4.82
4417,Hold On To Sunshine,L: A dark brown to black with a reddish hint at the fringe. A near equally dark half finger of fizzy head that disappears quickly and leaves no trace.,4.13

It is as if you were trapped in a world of pb cups, yet better",4.83
4422,Hold On To Sunshine,"Pours as dark as any stout I can remember. Mocha head with tight bubbles. Slightly metallic smell, not much else. Mouthfeel is fantastic, tastes coffee, toffee, peanut butter. Very, very good.",4.44
4423,Hold On To Sunshine,"A very tasty stout! There's a hint of peanut butter here, but coffee is still the dominant smell/flavor. It's got a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness, and I liked the mouthfeel, which was rich and creamy but not over-heavy and syrupy. I also liked the abundance of dark brown foam on this beer (EDIT: although a recent batch from 9/16/20 was much less carbonated). I think I like the Double Shot/Triple Shot varieties better than this, and I liked Fleeting Moment better too, but this was another very enjoyable stout from Tree House.",4.44

4431,Leaner,2017 bottle. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Side Project tulip. Acquired in a trade.,4.56
4432,Leaner,"sample pour from a 9L bottle at SP 3rd anniversary party. pours a hazy, juicy orange with soapy white head. nice collar of white on this one after the initial foam from the pour dies down. smells of peach candy, oak, a hint of white wine and perhaps even a little graham cracker crust. taste is sweet peach candy up front with the oak on the backend. it’s got a nice sourness to it. mouthfeel was full; well carbonated. extremely tasty. i love SP’s versions of Leaner and Casey’s was just as good. been a long while since i have had any Casey. damn good stuff.",4.67
4433,Leaner,"750ml bottle at share. pale golden with small ring of head. Stone fruit, peaches in the aroma, light savory notes. Lots more dessert elements in the taste, cinnamon, peaches, pie crust.",4.03
4434,Leaner,"9/10/2018 release. Drank on 9/28/2019. A wealth of slightly overripe, pulpy peach - wish it were funkier or more sour, but it's fantastic, regardless.",4.49
4435,Leaner,"Had side by side Casey's Leaner. Side Project's had a bit more funk and layers to it, but I preferred Casey's powerful fruit notes. Both were fantastic!",4.7
4436,Leaner,Foggy burnt gold with a fuzzy white blanket that recedes to a thin ring.,4.46
4437,Leaner,"01/2016 - incredible peach aromas, plus white wine, oakiness coming through; acidic as all hell on the palate and finish; slightly sweet, peachy keen, and barnyard on the palate, too; flavorful, spritzy finish.",4.42
4438,Leaner,On tap at Casey. White head. Golden yellow color.,4.75
4439,Leaner,"Bright veiled orange body, small white head diminishing to a ring, foam sticking to the glass, leaving lots of lacings.",4.65
4440,Leaner,"They have brewed this beer every year for the last 3 years straight and it's considered ""retired"" - when was the last time Oude Fermier or Ann was freshly brewed? those are still on the top 250 list- just food for thought.",4.43
4441,Leaner,Enjoyed out of a brown 750 mL bottle with a sticker denoting it as being bottled on 9/13/2016. Consumed as part of a small bottle share on 4/22. Poured into a teku style glass.,4.46
4442,Leaner,"Bomber batch 1: murky peach color, smells of acidic peach, lemon, and stone fruit.... Taste follows with a fairly strong sour component, peach, lemon, stone fruit and bourbon! Definitely sour, but rounded out by the fruit....nicely concentrated!",4.42
4443,Leaner,"Broke this treat out for beer 4,000.",4.55
4444,Leaner,"B2. This was a very nice beer, although it did not meet hype. Beer was flat when poured. The nose was all fruit, the taste was jammy goodness. Overall its very nice, kinda sucked that it was flat, and side by side i much preferred fou",4.38
4445,Leaner,Hazy yellow color without much head. Nose is like wild peach with fresh picked peaches. Taste is a lot of tartwith a lot of peaches. Feel is very full and enjoyable. This is a fantastic beer.,4.74
4446,Leaner,batch 2 - 10/15/16 - Enjoyed at Casey.,5
4447,Leaner,"killer beer, amazing to have in such close proximity with the westly, which although was apricot and not peaches, makes a great side by side. the beers are similar in some ways, but this was much more interesting on the yeast front, much less sour, equally fruity. peaches rule this one, drippy and ripe just like the namesake, aroma and flavor are the peak of ripeness, hardly sweet at all, just juicy and true, fuzzy and woody and awesome. soft yellowish orange beer, hazy and heady, well carbonated, dry, and who knew it was so strong on the booze? you dont taste it in the least nor feel it at all. brett out in front of souring cultures in this one for me, funky and layered and real mature. this must have spent quite a bit of time ageing, fermenting all this fruit out. the peaches are insane, yellow and bursting out of this. in some ways, the sourness takes over the apricot in westly a bit, here, the fruit leads the way and is merely accentuated by the yeasts. still plenty of acid, but a lot of nuance to it, maybe less wood, but more interesting i think. i like this as much as i liked either westly or fuzzy from side project in isolation, and think if they made more of it, it would have to be one of the most hyped beers ever. its immediately in that range with stuff like fou foune, cascade, allagash, and the other greatest peach or apricot lambics out there. lots of wheaty body, even oaty, fluffy and expansive, inviting, micro bubbles are very active in it too. i couldnt imagine this improving in any way, its a truly beautiful beer. thanks to claystation for sharing it with us, a real treat, and a new high water mark for casey, and thats really saying something if you have been keeping up with their releases lately...",4.64
4448,Leaner,"750ml bottle, first blend from the Casey side of the collaboration. Served in a stemmed glass.",4.5
4449,Leaner,750 mL into a wine glass.,4.59
4450,Leaner,"Wow, peaches for days! Poured from a bottle, hazy peach color and funky peach aroma. Was amazing at colder temps, and became more acidic as it warmed. Perfectly carbed, great collab between Casey and SP. Wish I could compare with the SP version.",4.94
4451,Leaner,"Lucky enough to try on tap at Falling Rocks in Denver. If you've heard the hype, believe it. It's what I imagine fermented peaches would taste like. Little alcohol, lots of peach flavor, a good sour funk that dances with the sweetness of peach. Never heard of this before my vacation in CO, I'd come back just for this!",4.81
4452,Leaner,"750 mL bottle. Super hazy pale orange. Smells of oak and lemony acidic yeast. Peaches are kinda sweet smelling. Taste is pretty sour. Strong sourness. Must be the Side Project part of the collab... Sour peaches. Heavy oak. Pretty nice. Heavy peach and almost too strong of a sourness. Tasty, though.",4.04
4453,Leaner,"This beer is very interesting. I would say that from Side Project I prefer Smooth and from Casey I prefer Family Preserves Peach, but this is still very good. Maybe a touch too acidic, but I'm not going to complain.",4.75
4454,Leaner,This might be the first sour worthy of a 5. The signature mouthfeel of Casey with that acidity of Side Project. This peach explosion is sheer perfection.,5
4455,Double Barrel Jesus,"2015 bomber into a tulip
About as pretty a beer as I’ve ever seen. Pitch black with a 1-finger khaki head leaving lovely lacing.",4.75
4456,Double Barrel Jesus,"I tried this alongside my previous favorite beer - the Evil Twin Aún Más A Jesús. This was clearly better. Unfortunately, I tasted close to 20 other top rated beers that day, and I didn't take any notes for a thorough review. But I know my scoring is accurate, as this and the Aún Más A Jesús were the first two beers I tasted that night. To me, this is the best of the best.",5
4457,Double Barrel Jesus,2016 vintage; drank 2/24/17 @ the Yarchives.,3.92
4458,Double Barrel Jesus,"2016 vintage poured from a 22 oz bomber moderately, resulting in a three-quarter inch tan head over a very dark brown body with some lacing. Wonderful nose of chocolate foremost with a bit of booze from the bourbon barrels as well. Taste mirrors nose with a chocolate flavor that won't quit. Not too boozy at all, but the bourbon is definitely there. Very nice mouthfeel, and overall, what a treat. Cheers!
After warming for half an hour or more flavors of caramel, toffee, and bitter chocolate come forward. Wow, so very nice and complex!",4.59
4459,Double Barrel Jesus,"Black color with a ring of brown foam. Aroma has lots of roasted malt, some umami and boozy bourbon. Taste is roasty, savory, chocolatey with some dark fruits on the finish. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Quite nice but not as spectacular as expected.",4.45
4460,Double Barrel Jesus,"22oz bottle thanks to Steve. First of the Jesus lineup. Normal inky black pour, small ring of head. Sweet, malty boozy aroma, molasses and wood. Taste is smooth, sweet and malty. Vanilla,brown sugar, bourbon. Syrupy and slick",4.03
4461,Double Barrel Jesus,"Tasted from bottle. Pours jet black with dark brown head. Huge chocolate aroma with molasses and some bourbon notes. Sticky thick chewy mouthfeel. Flavors of cocoa, caramel, molasses, toffee, bourbon, vanilla. Bourbon flavor is more subtle that a lot of BA beers. Very well done. Excellent sipper.",4.77
4462,Double Barrel Jesus,"2017 vintage drank on 14 May 17, bottled in February i believe. was delicious, cocoa, vanilla, slightly smokey, sweet bourbon, and oak. the base stout is great but this exceeded expectations. i have another one aging, can't wait to try it after the year mark.",4.96
4463,Double Barrel Jesus,"Poured into a snifter, the appearance was a thick dark brown to motor oil black color with a finger's worth of tan foamy head that slid off at a mild pace. Some stringy lace concaved at the sides.
The aroma leaned to the sweeter side - thick with pure chocolate fudge, milk chocolate cake, sugar and some whiskey at the end.
The flavor was sweet all of the way through pulling in that ""cake-like"" taste to give off a bigger and fuller aftertaste that somewhat reminded me of whiskey soaked fudge.
The mouthfeel was full bodied with a pure sipping quality about it because the ABV is not only felt but somewhat noticeable in it's ""heat."" Carbonation felt fine. Finish was thick and sweet.
Overall, diabetes in a bottle. A 22 oz. bottle can be tough to take down, but I did over the course of a 4 hour period. Not for the faint of heart, I suggest to share with a buddy.",4.14
4464,Double Barrel Jesus,Poured from a 750ml bottle into a snifter.,4.49
4465,Double Barrel Jesus,"super super sweet, more sweet decadent barrel notes (big vanilla, toffee, caramel, chocolate) come through than actually bourbon character. molasses and some mellow dark fruits and spice note, hint of oak and mellow bourbon. not much boozyness at all for the abv. medium-full mouthfeel, some chewy texture.",4.58
4466,Double Barrel Jesus,"2017 bottling (I think), poured into Kane chalice and let warm for an hour",4.41
4467,Double Barrel Jesus,Amazing! Huge chocolate flavor and a huge mouth feel that melds bourbon and oaky vanilla with the chocolate for a heavenly experience. Mod-palate I also get an interesting tobacco flavor. Complex. I love this one and it falls in with the maybe 5-10 beers I give a perfect rating.,5
4468,Double Barrel Jesus,Shared the 2017 version of this beauty with a couple friends last night and it was great! Had it alongside both the Maple Syrup barrel Evil Twin releases from this year and the Double Barrel Jesus was better than either of them! Nice boozy finish which will calm a bit as it ages I hope (since I have a 2015 DBJ in the cellar) but has a ton of chocolate and bourbon on the nose and palate.,4.9
4469,Double Barrel Jesus,"Pours black with small tan head. Slight bourbon notes on the nose. Good thick stout with slight barrel sweetness and very smooth finish. Was expecting a little more given the ratings, but still a good beer overall.",4.27
4470,Double Barrel Jesus,"Pours thick and black with a touch of light brown head. Complex nose.....fudge, whisky, leather, raisin, plum, roast, oak, and bourbon. Taste is very balanced.....I think the extra time in the barrels really cuts some of the sweetness that is typical in many evil twin offerings. Feel is thick and velvety with low carbonation. By far my favorite ET stout to date.....",4.6
4471,Double Barrel Jesus,Was cold out of the fridge. Let warm up to ~50 degrees prior to drinking.,4.43
4472,Double Barrel Jesus,"Poured into a Teku glass. Pours midnight black and as viscous as motor oil. Minuscule dark tan head. Dark fudge and whiskey feature primarily on the nose, with some vanilla, oak, and a touch of caramel also there. Taste follows, in a sense- heavy chocolate fudge with a huge, but not overpowering, amount of whiskey. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, full bodied, with a lower carb appropriate to style. Better than the non-BA Even More Jesus IMO. An huge beer, and a good one.",4.59
4473,Double Barrel Jesus,"Poured into a snifter. Viscous and opaque on the pour. Midnight in the glass. Minimal head with wisps of tan foam. Whiskey, vanilla, oak, cocoa, and roasted coffee on the nose. Not boozy-smelling. Tasted like rich fudge dipped in bourbon. The flavors played very well together. The whiskey predominated, and there was a tinge of sour on the finish, but overall it was balanced. Full-bodied but not overly sweet. Better than the non BA version.",4.3
4474,Double Barrel Jesus,"Pours black. Nice brown head. Two fingers. Fades slowly with light lacing. Aroma is awesome. Deep dark chocolate, molasses, coffee grinds and brown sugar. Taste is great too. Follows the nose. Deep chocolate fudge, coffee grinds and dark fruits. Another awesome stout from evil twin. Huge fan of their stouts.",4.68
4475,Double Barrel Jesus,"22oz bottle. Pours a viscous black color with a half inch of dark brown head. Some lacing. The aroma is a big whiff of Bourbon with fudge, molasses, coffee and earth. The taste is a large amount of woody Bourbon followed by fudge, chocolate syrup, leather, molasses, dark fruits and earth. Leathery, Bourbon finish with some more fudge. Heavy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Lots of alcohol heat. It's like drinking Bourbon soaked chocolate syrup. Overall, an outstanding BA Imperial Stout absolutely worth seeking out.",4.39
4476,Double Barrel Jesus,"Striking the difference between robust, decadent and drinkable lands the double barrel aged version of Evil Twin's imperial stout in no one's land, but also everyone's land.",4.7
4477,Double Barrel Jesus,"Poured from a bomber into a tulip. The true motor-oil black pour. Thick and black as can be. The nose is pure chocolate fudge - in fact, it smells identical to a chocolate ganache I made last week. The palate and mouthfeel are what really propel this beer to greatness. Chocolate ganache blends perfectly with appropriately subtle barrel aging, and darker fruits start to emerge only as the beer warms. In terms of mouthfeel, this is perhaps the thickest beer I've tasted. It's an incredible tour-de-force of the style, and one that does the chocolate side of Imp Stouts in an appreciably fresh way. Excellent.",4.47
4478,Double Barrel Jesus,This is my personal white whale. I've been trying to get my hands on this beer for years. Even More Jesus is my favorite stout and I've been dying to try the BA version.,4.7
4479,Double Barrel Jesus,"Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger brown foamy head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating around average time but on the faster side for an imperial stout. It settles into a layer on top and leaves minimal spotty lacing.",4.84
4480,BDCS,Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with a dark tan head. Little carbonation was visible.,4.37

A finger and a half of dense camel hued head with average retention but a unique fingerprint of wide and thin splotchy lacing.",4.55
4486,BDCS,"Immediately upon popping open the tab on this one I can tell I'm in for something rich and delicious. A dark liquid pours forth, Nearly jet black with a tight but creamy soft looking rich brown espresso head that lingers and lingers. Beautiful sticky lacing as well. This is gorgeous.",4.11

4490,BDCS,"12 oz can from Buckeyeboy. First Arkansas tick! Pours out black, tiny islands of tightly beaded bubbles. Oily and slick. Aroma is sweet, vanilla, chocolate, marshmallow, coffee. Taste mirrors the aroma, creamy and thick. Alcohol noticeable at the back. Smooth, tasty.",4.36
4491,BDCS,"12oz can labeled 2019 poured into a Spiegelau stout glass at fridge temp 10.3% ABV. The beer pours dense oily black with strong mocha head on hard pour. The head recedes to a half inch cap and leaves some lacing. The aroma is immediately noticeable after the pour with elements of chocolate, vanilla, oak and bourbon. The taste is semisweet caramel and roasted malt with coffee, vanilla, chocolate, oak and bourbon all popping through mid palate before a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is full to medium bodied, adequately carbonated and mostly dry in the finish. No sign of the ABV in the taste or aroma. Very balanced and not cloying, yet luxuriously rich. Overall, outstanding. Thank you @russpowell!",4.59
4492,BDCS,"Not the darkest pour in the world, but sits opaque black in the glass, with a super dense, mocha head. Smells like a freshly emptied bourbon barrel, which means a lot of the actual “beer” smell is overpowered. However, the flavors are much more balanced, and it’s scarily drinkable for over 10%. Like drinking a mountain of baker’s chocolate brownie batter. Bittersweet, vanilla, roasted coffee. Smooth as silk. Great stuff.",4.27
4493,BDCS,2017 version poured from a 12 oz. can at home. Thanks for the trade Jon! Bourbon and chocolate. Like a bourbon soaked brownie. Exceeded my expectations.,4.75
4494,BDCS,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely malts with chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak and coffee just beyond. It has a sweet onset, and then fades slightly towards bitter. Bourbon adds a kiss of heat on the back of the nose, but is far from over powering. Flavor profile is deep and expressive, hitting notes of caramel, vanilla, oak, chocolate, toffee, and bourbon. Roasty, toasty, caramely malts add a firm foundation for the sugary notes. Dark and expressive. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, creamy texture that carries just a touch of grittiness. Overall, dark and expressive, and yet far from overly complex or mind numbing.",4.6
4495,BDCS,"Good afternoon, NBS! Some yard work and additional gardening done this morning and now moving onto this one courtesy of",4.61
4496,BDCS,"Uhm, yum. Bourbon up front, bourbon in the nose, with a sweet, not cloying, aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full. Not warming, don’t taste the alcohol, but wow does it smack you in the head! I might revise my rating later when I’m not so smashed!",4.61
4497,BDCS,"Given to me by @jvgoor3786, and damn, am I glad for that! This is a real great beer. To quote Monty Python, black as the ace of spades, he was, with slightly brownish/purple thinning edges. Had half a fingertip of quickly dissipating head that left a minimal amount of lacing. Smell is a balanced mixture of bourbon barrel, chocolate, and malt. Well, maybe the barrel is more prevalent than the other two. On taste, however, it’s a lot more balanced between the three, with a little bit of vanilla and a bit of a fruity red wine note in there for good measure. Everything comes together-it’s sweet, roasty, and has a tangy, woodsy burn from the barrel. Feel is maybe where this outstanding beer is most outstanding. It’s big and bold from the barrel, but there’s some subtle silky smoothness from the malt and sweet adjuncts. Mouth watering and a healthy alcohol presence. The only thing I can say about it being ranked in the top 250 beers is that 172 may be too low. Thanks tons for sending me this one, Jason, and thanks to Ozark Beer Company for an awesome beer.",4.99

This was poured into a mini snifter.
The appearance was a fabulous looking dark thick black color. Slight film of a little eggshell white foamy head. Just a little bit of wispy concave lace.
The aroma captured a superb blend of roasty coffee bean, dark chocolate bittersweet character, sweet bourbon smooth woodiness with it's spice, some luscious dark fruits and a light sticky chocolate cake-like quality. Some
The flavor balances all of those prior mentioned aromas together in a semi-sweet fashion noting a sturdy bitterness and a prickling spice yet oh so good leveling to the aftertaste sweetly with a mellowing smooth roast.
The mouthfeel was between medium and full bodied with a fair sipping quality about it. No boozy heat as I thought would occur as many bourbon barrel-ed impy stouts tend to have, however, I don't see any dates other than the year so I'm not worried about it to be honest. Smooth semi-sticky finish with light cocoa powder-like slightly dry with bourbon finish.

4509,Impermanence,"Enjoyable to sip, but there was too much of a singular maple and cola dominance in the flavor to put this beer in the top-echelon for me. With less maple this would be all time. That being said, the mouthfeel/body is really pleasant and the 9% is well hidden.",4.17

A: Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a less than one finger, ruddy brown head, low retention, but solid rings of lacing.
S: Aromas of chocolate malted, caramel, maple syrup, and mocha.
T: Very sweet with lactose flavor unquestionably there. Flavors identical to the nose; somewhere between a chocolate malt and chocolate soda with a pit stop at pure maple syrup. Bitterness barely enough to prevent the sweeteness from becoming cloying.
M: Full bodied with moderate effervescence.
O: I am a stout enthusiast, but milk stouts are not typically my favorites. This was a bit sweet for my taste, but clearly well designed and executed. I could see it being paired with dessert.",4.21

This stout has barely a head when poured, quickly subsiding and releasing strong smells of coffee, burnt sugar, chocolate. Superbly controlled on the taste and the finish. There’s a bubbly mouthfeel which is refreshing. The sweetness of the maple syrup comes through, especially since our pairing was with a walnut maple ice cream.",4.78
4513,Impermanence,"Freekin’ wonderful. Didn’t have a clue what I got other than trying to do some homework to maximize my trip to THouse. I really like stouts and as I am here at my iPad scarfing down this beer I can only say, the description on the can says it all for me. Ditto!
I just scarfed down my second one and like it even more. Smooth, subtle, in your face great if you like stouts this is amazing.",4.6
4514,Impermanence,Jet black body topped with an immensely dense and creamy light tan head. Rich dark malt aroma; loads of mild chocolate and cocoa; charred grain. The flavor mirrors the aroma only amplified; heavy milk chocolate and decadently savory cocoa sweetness; bitterness is there but buried deeply within the malt sweetness. Heavy body; rich and creamy; sludgy; mainly sweet mouthfeel but offset with some charred grain dryness.,4.47

4516,Impermanence,"Impermanence is on the sweeter side of stouts - super rich, the maple comes through a lot, with a touch of coffee and a bunch of chocolate. It's got a thick, syrupy feel, but had enough of a malty base that it didn't feel like cough syrup. A tasty stout overall, but expect a lot of sweetness in this one, which may or may not be up your alley.",4.29
4517,Impermanence,"The concept of inundating a brew with ingredients may work in the world of IPA, but it does not (IMO) in the world of stout. The balance is lost completely. This pours like sickly treacle or motor oil and its so heavy bodied it drinks like sludge. Way too sweet. Yes, imperial stouts almost always knock your socks off with strength, but usually there are some understated flavors that carry themselves gracefully... this lacks all nuance. Its too much. American brewers are often guilty of being overly ambitious and pushing their brews too far away from tradition... this is a perfect example of pushing a stout to the point of being un-drinkable, to where it no longer is beer... and in that regard, it is successful. This is an ice cream topping.",3.58

4522,Impermanence,"Poured from a 16oz can dated 12/19/19 to a diagonally cut tumbler.
This is an extremely dark, black beer. You only get a hint of brown in the pour stream. A minimal suggestion of a head rings the glass even with an aggressive pour, and this despite what appears to be moderate carbonation. I think that has to do with the viscosity (see mouth feel below).
Maple and caramel hit the nose, but not super strong.
The taste is another matter. Complex and powerful flavors to analyze. It's sweet. All ingredients listed on the label present themselves one after another as if designed to take turns. 1-Chocolate, 2-Maple, 3- Caramel, 4- Coffee. The maple almost gives a barrel-aged impression, despite this not being aged. I could almost say there is an illusion of smoke.
Mouth feel is right up there with the taste- Like thinned maple syrup. If I could make this thicker by boiling it down I would put it on pancakes. Maybe that would be a waste of a fantastic beer, but it sounds kind of interesting right now.
As I pause in writing this my lips are sticking together.
I like bitter and dry stouts better than sweet ones, but for this one I will make an exception. Fantastic.",4.67
4523,Impermanence,"A very nice. well-balanced beer. A bit too cloying for my taste but overall one of the better coffee, milk stouts that I've had. Alcohol is noticeable but not overwhelming. Coffee character is what propels this beer to its heights.",4.31

This synergy of flavor made it perfect as a post-dinner beer. I felt like I was having dessert on a fluffy chocolate cloud, as I licked maple syrup off of my favorite model. Hints of vanilla permeated through my nostrils. A truly unique beer and a truly unique experience.",4.56

It smells like molasses, chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, and hints of toffee. The taste is truly incredible. At lower temperatures the chocolate and alcoholic sweetness take the center stage with vanilla extract like aftertaste. The flavor gets better as it warms and almost taste likes a dark chocolate cinnamon roll. It's very very thick and completely coats the mouth, but it's slightly carbonated and much more refreshing than anyone could ever expect. It goes down illegally smoothly for a 12% beer.

This St. Louis, Missouri's stout is so enjoyable, I wasn't in a reviewer's frame of mind on first sip. Then the reviewer in me took over (it's a holdover from my pre-economic crash of 2008 journalism days).
It poured a medium-thick beige head when I went back to add to my glass. (I have a habit of tilting the glass.)
Anyway, persistent ring with dissipating lacing. (A note: The bottles were bought today.)
Mouthfeel is thick like a chocolate stout.
The flavor has a nice heat from the Ancho chili peppers. And, I suppose, from the 11.5% ABV, though it is pleasantly not too boozy.
OK, well, that's it for the reviewer in me. I am cellaring the second bottle. Vertical tastings are encouraged, Perennial says, but I don't know of anyone who has saved vintages from different years for a vertical tasting.
Well, back to enjoying and listening to Abraxas, the one by Santana.",4.71

M: This beer is on the heavier side of things with a silky feel on the palate. Carbonation is soft but adequate for the style while the ABV ensures that this beer has a dying finish.

The beer pours a dark mahogany color with some ruby highlights when I hold my glass to the light.
A fizzy and short-lived beige head of 1 cm foams up and fades to nothing after the first few sips of the beer.
the aroma on this is rich and malty with dark chocolate, toffee, prunes, raisins, and plums mixing with a bit of red grape and maybe some port wine character. No hop presence on the nose, with only a little bit of fusol alcohol notes to remind me of the 12% ABV.
First sip reveals a medium body with sticky mouthfeel and fine tingly carbonation. The beer is a bit of a sipper due to ABV, but the stickiness coats my palate and lips and slows my consumption as well.
Flavor is again all malt with toffee, prune and raisin with more brown sugar and molasses than I got on the nose. I also get a little bourbon, but again the hops are absent here.
Booze comes through on the finish with some warming down my throat on the swallow.
This is a sipping beer and I really enjoy the complexity and texture. The dark color makes me think this could easily be in the old ale category as well and the ABV makes this take almost all night to finish my glass, but as I stated, I enjoy this one a lot and find the complexity enjoyable.

S: A magnificent aroma that fills the room.. Ripe grapefruit rind and orange peal. White pepper, oak, light vinegar, a touch of vanilla. Musty basement like funk makes me want to dance.
T: Acidic fruit rind, ripe grapefruit, orange and lemon. Of coarse the acidity is strong but never gets overbearing. Musty funk balances that beautifully. Like going down into a wonderful cellar. Peppery spice with light oak and vanilla. Just amazing.
M/O: A medium body that is perfectly carbonated. Effervescent and spritzy. Everything is so well balanced here, I just can't get enough. Normally, even for someone like me that loves the style, the acidic sourness can get in the way of how much I want to drink it. Though this never gets, in any way, difficult to enjoy.",4.55

4606,Appervation,"Sampling a cellar temp 500 ml bottle poured into my snifter. 2020 vintage.
The bottle is part of a swap with @Artizen, thank you!
The beer pours a pitch black color with minimal dense tan head that foams up only a little bit even after a very aggressive pour. This minimal foam fades away to the thinnest of edge layers quickly after the pour.
Aroma is dark malt, lots of bourbon, some dark chocolate and a bit of toffee. Fairly sweet and robust, but not really boozy at all and no hop profile shows up.
First sip reveals a silky smooth texture and medium to thick body. The carbonation is gentle, spacious and rolls softly across my palate.
Flavor is what I expect for style and what the nose advertises. I get some roasted malt and toffee with a bit of dark chocolate and a good boost of bourbon note. I also get molasses here and some dark fruit too. Again, no hop character, and the booze is very dangerously well hidden.

And of course, the taste does indeed clobber you with huge crescendo of coffee, fruit, booze, char, leather and umami. Fantastic. The mouthfeel, again, is just as it should be.

Tons of oak, caramel, alcohol-soaked cherries, leather, sweet molasses. This, to me, smells old and delicious. Taste is crazy. Immediately picking up strong nutty flavors. The lack of carbonation conveys a syrupy taste. Picking up lots of dark cherries, blackberries, toffee, burnt wood bitterness, leather, rubber, oak, and maybe a hint of soy sauce. Mouthfeel is creamy and thick - very bold. Overall, this is a mesmerizing beer with a deep hierarchy of flavors. Absolutely fantastic, and an experience I won't forget.",4.74

Taste is very bourbon forward, especially before it warms. It’s to the point even after it warms it’s a somewhat hot from the bourbon. I’m not getting much maple, but am getting lots of dark roast coffee. Also dark chocolate, so that aspect of the beer definitely shows. Some more faint vanilla and even a little dark fruit. Got a hint of caramel sweetness, too. Feel is right there with other bourbon beers. Overall, it’s good but I think it needs a year to mature.

This was a must-have because of it's rating on here and even though this was old, this was such a hop bomb that I had to take my time sipping this. Yes, this beer was quite intense but it was worth the effort to enjoy as the label was quite indicative of what the liquid was like!",4.35

4691,Crusher,This one is probably worthy of a full review... First great label - Fairly simple but the green and yellow really pop... Color is a slightly hazy mango-ish pale orange... Whipped white head with stellar retention... A bit of lacing clings to the glass... The aroma is everything you would expect - a wide array of tropical fruit and light pine... I could keep my nose hovered over the glass all day... Robust flavor with depth and exceptional mouthfeel... Big flavor but subtle mouthfeel... As expected a word class beer and exceptional IPA... Cheers...,4.66

4700,Crusher,"The Alchemist's Crusher is what craft beer should be all about -- seizing the opportunity to create something memorable, rather than adhering to comfortable standards. Poured from a 16 oz. can to a typical pint glass, Crusher took on a dark pineapple appearance. The smell was incredibly balanced and inviting. The taste, however, highlighted the experience. The piney/dank flavor (some hints of fresh scallion) was complimented by muted, citrusy notes. I'm a big fan of Six Point's Resin, but Crusher steps the style up a level.",4.27
4701,Crusher,"Hazy apricot color with sudsy white head. Great retention and lacing. Aroma is just straight fresh hoppiness. Bitter everywhere; up front, in the middle, at the end. Some light waves of peach, pine, and mango, but bitterness dominates. Dry and crisp. Good carbonation. This beer is all about fresh hops. Usually not a fan of overwhelming bitterness, but this is a great beer.",4.2
4702,Crusher,"Tarnished orange in color with a murky, hazy appearance. Poured with a tall, creamy white foam with very good retention. Herbal, earthy, dank hop aromas with a hint of over-ripe orange. Medium malty aroma. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Pleasant, creamy smooth feel with light richness followed by boozy warmth through the finish. Herbal, dank hop flavors with a solid malty backbone. Medium high, spicy hop bitterness through the middle that taper to pinr hop flavors and boozy heat. Finished with lingering pine hop bitterness and light, prickly boozy notes. Dank and bitter with a enough malt to balance the hop character and a pleasant booziness. ",4.26

S. Bitter citrus, pine, white bread, pineapple, mango. Yep, smells great.
T. Mild mango, piney, pithy, oranges, lemons and limes, green vegetables, a little more pine, light malt, white bread. Aftertaste is grapefruit and pine.
F. Leaning toward a full feel, resinous, dry.

4709,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,"I received 2 bottles from @roguer in the NBS BIF #13. Poured into a stout glass at 54 degrees. It pours nearly ink black with a half finger of creamy, light mocha-colored head and a generous sheen of creamy lacing. Its fragrant nose features roasted malt, maple syrup, toffee, freshly-brewed coffee, and a whiff of molasses. Oh. wow! It's like eating pancakes with maple syrup and drinking a good cup of coffee in a favorite diner. It's nutty and roasty and the coffee provides an acidic bitterness that balances the sweetness of the maple syrup. There are notes of toffee, fudge, tobacco, and earthy char. There's no real taste of bacon but the depth of the flavors trigger the imagination. What's truly amazing is the mouth feel. For a 6.4% Porter the mouth feel is amazingly thick and creamy. It's like drinking an imperial stout. It's moderately carbonated and really drinks easily. Overall, I now understand why so many BAs love this Porter. It causes sensory overload. Just superb!",4.51

The drinking hits with sweet chocolate malts upfront, a smooth flow and a semi-dry finish. On the sweeter side of the spectrum but its not over-kill. There is a lot going on here. Big flowing flavors of sweet maple syrup, soft coffee grinds, and subtle smoke. Additional notes of vanilla, brown sugar, cocoa, and caramel. A rather moderate mouthfeel that offers a lush, rich, and creamy feel. Nothing to off-putting in terms of chalk or cola flavoring.",4.91

4730,Last Snow,"Received from @roguer in a NBS BIF #13 box. Canned on 9/23/2020. Poured into a pint glass. It pours a very dark cola color with a half finger of creamy, khaki-colored head and nice sheen of lacing. There is abundant chocolate, burnt coffee, coconut, and mint on the nose, along with roasted malt. Its taste truly follows its smell with the chocolate and coconut dominating. It tastes like a Mounds bar although it's not overly sweet. There is a nice touch of bitterness at the finish. For a Porter the mouth feel is incredibly rich, thick, and creamy. It has lite/moderate carbonation and drinks very easily for 6.4% ABV. Overall, I'm very impressed. It has the flavor and mouth feel of a Stout. Even at 9 months the coconut is robust but not gimmicky. Last Snow is the real deal and I would gladly seek it out if available in New Jersey.",4.33
4731,Last Snow,"Poured from bottle into tulip, good 2 finger dark tan head, good retention and lacing. Jet black on the glass, no light gets thru. Smells of roasted malt, roasted coffee and coconut on the nose. Taste follows nose, coconut is the king though from the first sip to the finish it is all about the coconut. Not too sweet, and no roast bitterness to speak of. Easy drinking beer",4.33
4732,Last Snow,"Cannot believe I have not rated this before. While not available here what I have is courtesy of @vabeerguy & @DoctorZombies. This has to be one of my top all time beers, as close to perfect as it gets. I could give it straight 5's but nothing is perfect.",4.88
4733,Last Snow,"From a bottle into a snifter...this is a really great use of coconut, probably the best use that I've come across...not over-done, but really solid and layered.

Strong roast coffee nose with a whiff of coconut behind. Roast!, espresso, burnt brown sugar; coconut on backend. Light body, moderate minus carbonation; bitter roast bite on tip of tongue. Overall, this is a C+ coffee porter; it feels thin, and the taste is good and roasty until I get to the off artificial flavor/linger; whenever I see “made with natural flavors” on the label, I am wary...",3.82

The body is velvet smooth, so lush and creamy, yet doesn't get stout heavy, a wonderful porter mouthfeel. Just a simply wonderfully made beer",4.43

4741,Last Snow,"A porter called “ Last Snow” from a Florida brewery (Funky Buddha) had to be interesting, but I never expected it to be exceptional. Revealing beautiful flashes of ruby and garnet when held up to a backlight, and a bouquet that is redolent of coffee, chocolate and coconut, it’s no surprise that one person declared it to be like a “liquefied Mounds Bar.” And that analogy remains relevant on the palate. A smooth mouthfeel and a sweetish finish produce a wonderfully crafted beer. Some have criticized the sweetness level, but I didn’t find it to be excessive. It’s a truly great dessert beer and one that’s on a par with another favorite of mine called Samoa This. And as it warms, it gets even more flavorful, making it a great choice for any Snow Birds in the Northeast who want to sip it in front of a roaring fire. That said, Last Snow is definitely not a session beer. One and done at one sitting would be my recommendation. But if you’re a fan of those flavors, you’d be wise to keep a sixer on hand...especially if you run out out Mounds bars.",4.77
4742,Last Snow,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a large, creamy, lasting head. Smell is a lovely balance of coconut and roasted malt/coffee notes, with just a hint of cinnamon and earthy spice.

Finishes with a very light bitterness and some sweet coconut and roasted coffee notes lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.",4.45

4744,Last Snow,"Pours dark brown with a good finger of brownish head.
Smells tasty, coconut, chocolate, roasty malts. Not getting much coffee.
Taste is definitely coconut and roastiness. Getting vanilla as well. Lingering sweetness that reminds me of pipe tobacco.
Nice full body for a porter, one thing that typically detracts from my enjoyment of the style is a thin body, not happening with this one.
Overall a great beer that if/when I see it on the shelves hear I will definitely grab some more.",4.47
4745,Last Snow,"The aroma is downright intoxicating when it comes to coconut qualities - this really does smell like a liquefied Mounds bar! Coffee, roasted malt, and (of course) dark chocolate all offer a nice ballast to the coconut. One niggle: the additions are so bold, they overpower the porter backbone somewhat. This beer is a total showstopper on the taste buds...well, at least for the first few sips. Apart from a slightly roasted opening, coconut utterly dominates in the best/worst way around the middle and end. Coffee plays second fiddle to the coconut flavors, just like the aroma indicated. Speaking of how it ends, the finish comes across like this coconut coffee porter had three tons of table sugar clumsily added to it - there's that ""so sweet, it's somehow bitter"" sensation I get from a select few dessert beers (like Creme Brulee from Southern Tier...or Maple Bacon Coffee Porter from Funky Buddha themselves!) At the end of the day, the actual flavor of this beer is a total letdown next to the awesome nose. Plus, it feels thin and angular - not a good combination with the extreme levels of sweetness. Said extreme sweetness ultimately chokes the drinkability factor. Carbonation is medium high. I do enjoy this more than their Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, but eh. I don't need to have this again either way.",3.24

4748,Last Snow,"Whoa! this is expensive for Non Imperial Stout. I forked out 5$ for a single 12 oz. bottle. I'm a fan of Funky Buddha & what they do for the Florida craft beer scene. There is interesting looking chocolate snowman artwork on the label. Wow! I am getting big coconut aroma from this beer. I am not seeing any DATE ON THE BOTTLE. A beer that has coffee & coconut adjuncts needs to have a date on the bottle somewhere. I am ascertaining big coconut, slight coffee. I can't lie to you this is scrumptious. If you like a sweet stout that does not have lactose added to it then this is up your alley although it is costly, but I don't downgrade beer because of their price. Pretty good porter that almost feels like a full bodied roasty stout. This is a sweet stout all the way with slight roasted malts, this is a beer that I would not session due to the sweetness of the coconut & the edginess of the coffee but it's a great one time, one bottle treat for the evening, but it's definitely not something that I would want to session Cheers!

4752,Last Snow,"What do you have for breakfast in Florida? Well, I'm going with this. Sitting on a balcony looking at the beach I'm pouring this from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out beautiful for the style looking like coffee with highlights and not being too dark for a porter. Forms a great dense and creamy tan colored crown. The smell is a bomb of excellent coconut. Fresh coconut mixing with beautiful chocolate. Wow this could be a candle. The taste comes in with strong but good coffee and turns into that great coconut that lingers long after it's gone. The mouthfeel is perfect for the style with good carbonation and not too thick or thin. Perfect. This is an absolutely great porter that I wouldn't change anything about. But I will State one thing before I go! I would STILL choose a Death by Coconut over this!!!! I'm out!!!!",4.83

4756,Leche Borracho,"Purchased for $20 from a private collector. 3 year old 500 ml bottle from 2018 poured into a snifter. This is my first Bottle Logic brew, as I'm in Ohio so it's difficult to get California beer out here. Poured out thick and darkest brown with a quick and active head that bubbled up furiously for about 15 seconds then rapidly shrank into a ring around the bottle, then disappeared completely. The strongest scent coming up from this beer is bourbon, even though there's also tequila barrels at work. Also notes of vanilla, chocolate, and a little tingle on the nose from the ancho peppers. The scent is very strong and peppery, and threatens to singe my nose hairs if i inhale too deeply too quickly. Truly a delicious smell, very complex and tantalizing. There is a strong and sweet malt backbone to this beer upon first sip. It's very thirst quenching. After getting the rounded sweetness of the sugars and vanilla, cinnamon washes through my mouth, followed by the tequila and bourbon. It's funny, but i can definitely taste both the tequila and bourbon independently, and i didn't think i would be able to. Also a bit smoky. The pepper comes last, stinging the back of the throat and giving it a nice finish. Mouthfeel is definitely thicker and syrupy, with a nice douse of effervescence. Overall, the smell knocked my socks off. And the taste was very complex and layered. Although I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite beers, it's definitely the result of an interesting recipe and the chef certainly knew what they were doing, to allow all the various flavors to come out. So it's getting my top marks for being unique, an important quality i seek in beer.",4.9

L: Pitch black in appearance. A tiny head that retained a tight khaki ring around the perimeter of glass. Actually get a little bit of lacing on the glass, which is commendable.
S: Aromas of cinnamon, bourbon, chocolate, dates, molasses, nutmeg and subtle milk sugar sweetness. Great smelling and not boozy.
T:Man this is unique. The thing that stands out to me is it is so flavorful even when cold. Tons of chocolate and cinnamon up front. The pepper spice is noticeable but it ins't overly done, just perfectly implemented on the finish. The lactose is prevalent as well, giving a milk complexity to the flavor reminding me of horchata. The tequila barrel is present on the initial profile but the finish is all bourbon. Fantastic.
F: Full in body, medium to heavy in weight. Nice smooth feel with decent heft.
O: An incredible offering from BL. I am super glad to try it on tap, and can't wait to see how it fares from the bottle. I am very glad to have tired. For the record, the wife approves of this beer (which is saying something as she isn't a stout drinker). Cheers!",4.5

As a big non-fan of tequila-barrel beers, I'm happy to report that the barrel plays well with the rest of the beer, and overall the flavors integrate better than I expected they would.

Big hefty feel to support all of this. Outstanding.",4.59

4777,Leche Borracho,Great spicy brew. Good mixture of barrel and heat. Thought this was one of the best BA spiced beers I've ever had up there with BA cake and BA oro negro. Really impressed how bottle logic's descriptions are always on point.,4.56
4778,Leche Borracho,"Rich vanilla nose, chocolate, slight booziness to it. Big dark chocolate and cinnamon on the tongue, finishes with a slight kick. Definitely a well layered balanced beer, however I would have preferred a slightly higher bourbon profile on the nose and taste.",4.66
4779,Leche Borracho,"Unfortunately, I rushed this taste a bit. Dark pour with a little tan head to it, this beer had a nice cinnamon backbone which ran from front to back, with the peppers adding some grip and texture. Well-structured and put together.",4.44
4780,Matt,"2019 Vintage. Opened 10-8-21.
No head, only a few bubbles around the edge of a dark brown body. No lacing.
Brown sugar, molasses, booze soaked raisins, wet wood,.
Smoke, apple brandy (green apple) -- there's a lot going on here, more than I'm able to describe.
A little bit of savory - almost soy but not detrimental at all just unique.
Full body, slick mouthfeel and low to no carbonation. Lots of heat and a lengthy semi-sweet finish.
Very Good.",4.15
4781,Matt,"Pours murky out of the bottle and opaque in the glass. Dark brown, nearly black. No head to speak of, just a few fizzy bubbles. Aroma is ridiculous, rich and luscious with massive complexity. Sweet, vinous, smokey. Dark fruits, charred wood, earthy almost nutty bourbon characters. A scotch like level of complex whiskey characters. Brandy and subtle port bring some notes reminiscent of a fine spirit. Taste is also quite complex but it’s much more smoke forward. I get big charred wood, huge leather, rolling tobacco. There are dark fruits present but not to the degree of the nose, what’s there is pretty vinous. I also get oaky notes, subtle unsweetened cocoa. Whiskey notes are also subtle compared to the nose, but they are there. The flavor profile is very nice, but I’m a bit bothered by the relatively thin mouthfeel and lack of carbonation that makes it feel outright flat. ABV however is well masked and it’s reasonably drinkable.",4.26

4789,Matt,"Bottle, 2019 release:
These still HotD offerings have trouble looking overly enticing through no fault of their own. A darker than medium brown, it appears somewhat opaque. As stated no head, so no lacing.",4.58
4790,Matt,"Bottle from Jeremy. Ruddy brown pour, soft bubbly head. Woody, malty aroma. Taste also leans on the malt, woody, earthy notes. Finishes Dry. Excellent. update: 2013 vintage bottle thanks to Buckeyeboy. Dark brown and relatively flat. Swwet dark malts, pit fruit, woody, smoky. Taste is rich, sweet and boozy, slippery, and very tasty.",4.01
4791,Matt,2013 version on tap at the 25th anniversary party.,4.77
4792,Matt,"Gifted from @lingenbrau. I thought it lost carbonation, but he told me their stuff is normally under carbed. Either way, it's a winner. Dark muddy brown color. Smell is boozy, oaky, apply. Taste is the old ale style, malty, strong booze, sweet, smoky, woody barrel and apple notes. Smooth, mild burn, trying not to hold the lack of carb against it as I'm not sure if that was how it was intended. Very good.",4.56
4793,Matt,2016 bottle poured into a snifter glass.,3.72
4794,Matt,"Another unique and wonderful brew from HOTD. I’d call it somewhere between an American Strong and an Old Ale, but that doesn’t matter because it’s just delicious. After a couple years in my cellar the carbonation has suffered a bit, but many of HOTD’s offerings start out that way, so it doesn’t seem a problem. Nose and taste are both truly world class, so complex and so well integrated that I can’t begin to describe them - you just have to be here!",4.37
4795,Matt,"This one pours a very dead looking and murky purplish brown, with no head and no lacing.",3.56
4796,Matt,"Hardly zero head or carbonation in a 2013. Taste was bourbon soaked raisans. Sweet but quite pleasant. It didn't look great and it was prob a little thin for the abv and the barrel, but defintely respect the old ale style and would not turn it down again.",4.26
4797,Matt,2016 ventage. Dark appearance with no head. Aroma is nutty. Taste is also nutty bourbon with a fairly strong sharp alcohol bite. This should be aged longer to eliminate the alcohol taste.,4.19
4798,Matt,"L: pours thick brown with no head at all. No hiss when I opened the cap...still
But I don't think this was intentional, kind of worried
S: huge bourbon...seriously reminds me of anabasis almost to a t in the nose
T: there is something wrong here....there is a nasty tabacco flavor",3.53
4799,Matt,"Had been sitting on this for a long time. Wow! Absolutely delicious. A little on the sweet side but very tasty. Soy sauce, tobacco, cocoa, definitely a sipper.",4.35
4800,Matt,Was lucky enough to finally track down a bottle of Matt and enjoy it with a friend. Strong caramel flavors in this Old Ale. Very tasty but absolutely a sipper as this was strong and boozy. Solid but wouldn't probably track it down again.,4.5
4801,Matt,"2016 vintage. Poured a fully opaque dark brown color with just the very fewest bubbles an aggressive pour could achieve. No head, thus no retention or lacing. Lots of sludge left in the bottom the bottle as well.",3.91
4802,Matt,"While I wasn't blown away by AFTW, this beer rocked my world! I love the flavor complexities, and enjoyed sipping on this for quite a while. I know it's on the top 250 but I never see anyone talking about it. And they should be.",4.68
4803,Matt,"all of the beers we had at hair of the dog were highlights, so its hard to single out this 2008 matt as the standout, but it was pretty darn impressive. no idea what it tasted like fresh, but some time in the bottle has really done it well. one of the few beers i can think of that could stand up over time like this, not a lick of oxidation or staleness in here at all, just a smooth mellow well integrated brew all the way around. rich syrupy viscous dark dark brown pour, still with a little bubbling head on it. notes of campfire, black licorice, cigar, brandy, raisin, and dark chocolate all waft out from the glass slowly and patiently, weaving a complex aromatic tapestry that is entirely unique. burnt leather and bourbon come through the dark english or german malts, rauch type smoke has mellowed some, sticky bread pudding, root beer, then they apple grappa stuff in the finish. man is this layered! it doesnt quite have that roasted barley stout quality to it, it doesnt go that deep, but in its bitter absence, there arises this space for other flavors usually lost to it, and i think this lands perfectly in the middle of all of them. i am amazed how this has done over time, i expected more of a novelty at this age, but that wasnt the case at all. rich and velvety on the palate, the warming alcohol seems necessary too. brilliant beer, what a treat!",4.38

4808,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,"I’ve had better offerings from other half. This is sort-of a simple, sweet-base one dimensional — albeit tasty — beer. I get that it’s a DDH all citra juice bomb. And that’s cool. I like it fine. Just that a beer with these kind of reviews I expected more. Maybe the reviews are pre-craft-beer revolution. Cuz if I had this beer 5 years ago I would have been dumbfounded!",3.67
4809,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,"Pours a turbid and opaque color of grapefruit juice with over a finger of head. Surprisingly, the first note that I got on the nose was dankness. Secondary on the nose are the citrus notes.",4.28

4812,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,"Pour produced a common frothy top that befits many a cloudy beer. The coloring fits on the paler yellow end, lacking ay orange hue that some hazies bring to the table. The aforementioned head had some stickiness to it and provided a fair amount of lacing.",4.36
4813,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,"Very hazy bright yellow body with a beautiful thick white head.
The nose is pungeant on resinous weed, dank mango, a bit of orange.
The taste follows with the orange at first then a really nice resinous bitterness. I love this long lasting bitterness
The mouthfeel is quite coating. Juicy.
Overall, from far the best other half beer I've had. A great example of an ipa",4.75

4815,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,"A dark gold, orangeish color that I've only seen otherwise on Mylar Bags. Aroma was consistent with the taste, which was a deep sweetness followed by a nice bracing bitterness. Very fruity and complex. Thick, creamy feel. As good as it gets, at least the batch I had.",4.88
4816,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,So excited to find this brew at Canal’s in Berlin NJ. Top notch super hazy murky deep golden look with an offwhite head with some staying power. Wonderful fruity and sweet Citra nose on this puppy. Ooh that’s tasty. Very fruit driven and sweet with a drying gentle grapefruit and pine bitterness. I’d call this just south of creamy with good carbonation for the style. This is well balanced but I think I like the DDH Double Mosaic Dream better although this is a fine brew. Love the feel along with the flavor of this one.,4.44
4817,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,"Canned on 2/3/2021 so reviewed at 2 weeks. Poured into a snulip glass. It pours. a murky, dirty tangerine color with a half finger of creamy, milk-white head and thick soapy lacing. A bright, fruity nose featuring lemon, lime, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and soft floral hops. The taste is huge and fruity. It opens with tart lemon peel and grapefruit rind that is quickly matched by sweet notes of pineapple, peach, mango, and lychee. You won't find a better showcase of Citra hops. They provide lots of fruit up front and clean bitterness at the finish. This ale has a plush, pillowy mouth feel with pleasant carbonation, and a punchy 8.5% ABV that gives it substance without overpowering. Overall, this is an exquisite New England DIPA that merits its lofty rating.",4.43

4826,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,"A: The beer is very hazy to cloudy pale whitish yellow in color. It poured with a quarter finger high bright white head that left a thin film of bubbles covering the surface, a narrow collar around the edge, and lots of lacing down the sides of the glass.
S: Moderate to strong aromas of gooseberries and lychee are present in the nose.
T: The taste has very strong flavors of gooseberries and lychee along with notes of lime and passionfruit.
M: It feels medium-bodied and very juicy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer is like an explosion of Citra hops in your mouth. It's incredibly juicy yet also complex in that it has a variety of flavors.",4.49
4827,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,"Hazy yellow body with a white head and lacing. Lemon, orange pulp, some lime, mango, honey and dank and dry hop aromas, more potent than the orignal yet softer. The taste is stupid, gets so much juice and intensity from the smell plus pineapple, grapefruit and melon, sweet, bitter, dry, juicy, tropical and citrusy, a feast for the taste senses. Feel is soft, hazy to the max, potent yet crushable, could use a touch more hop texture variety but I'm nitpicking. Amazing",4.67

4831,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Covid screwed up Huhaphu last March and I got some perks because of it. Wife and I travelled to Tampa from the Daytona area for a day trip and CC had a small trailer set up with several of their best brews there to taste.

4836,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium, creamy, dark brown head. Smells of rich, dark chocolate, cinnamon and chili peppers, with a hint of vanilla, oak and quite a hot bourbon note. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by rich, bitter chocolate, roasted malts and spicy chili peppers, with a good amount of vanilla and lighter notes of cinnamon, dark fruits: fig, raisins, some oak and a light earthiness. There's also quite a hot, boozy bourbon note to this. It starts out a little sweet, with the chocolate and vanilla standing out the most, but turns more a lot more bitter and warming in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium bitterness, vanilla notes, and some heat, both from the chili and booze, lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation.",4.39

The smell definitely gets better as it warms with the bourbon barrel notes dominating and also the cinnamon, chile peppers, and cacao nibs that make the regular Hunahpu’s so amazing are hiding behind the barrel notes.

4845,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"750ml bottle, of the 2017 release (blue El Catador label). Served in a Cigar City snifter glass. Pours a dark motor oil black body, half finger mocha head, short retention, not much in way of lacing. Big legs on this bad boy. Smell is rich bourbon and chocolate fudge; the bourbon is a smooth and slightly warming presence, oak and charred caramel. Milk chocolate, touch of cinnamon, and touch of cocoa rounds it out. It's a very smooth, well-integrated bourbon barrel on the aroma working with the base beer. Flavour is a bit muddled, however. I get a bit of milk chocolate and a touch of cinnamon up front, with a more astringent and bitter cocoa. Hunahpu's has never been a super cinnamon forward beer, and it shows here. There is mostly milk chocolate, cocoa, and a fair bit of whiskey flavour and heat. A bit of vanillin perhaps thickens up the mouthfeel on the backend some. I do notice a fair bit of extra heat on the backend, that lingers for a little bit after you've finished your sip, a bit of a sting to it. Pretty solid, and the balance is what I remember the base beer to have, except the bourbon adds on an additional dimension. The mouthfeel is heavy and thick-bodied, lower in carbonation but adequate, oily with a bit of whiskey and pepper heat on the finish. A fun beer to finally tick, even if it took until the 2017 release to do so.",4.4

Great nose, with hints of cinnamon and spice predominant, and a hint of barrel. From there, I guess I was a bit let down. Having the regular version on a few occasions, I was expecting the barrel treatment to give this beer a boost. Instead, the flavors come off a little muddled. Yes, I got some cinnamon, cocoa, and chilies(most unaffected), but they were struggling to the forefront with the presence of the barrel itself.",4.33
4848,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours opaque black with no head, just a tight band around the edges. Nose reveals rich chocolate and ethanol. Taste expresses cocoa, cinnamon, honey and a kiss of heat. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation. Overall, a solid offering.

4857,Aurelian Lure,"one of the jester king beers that i have been unable to track down until now, highly acclaimed and on my list forever, stoked to finally have sourced it. its definitely one of the best apricot wild beers in the game, so intense and so natural at the same time, in a lot of ways reminds me of when i tried cascade apricot for the first time, and just realized that there was no more true expression of apricots in beer than that, this is the same, but much less sour, and with the classic jester king funky yeast mix that makes their beers so distinctive all the time. a pulpy orange hazy look to this one, under a short but lasting white head. the nose is incredible, the best feature of this for me and where i really appreciate the apricots most, fuzzy and real, fleshy and juicy and sweet and ripe, their absolute essence. some higher level bacterial acidity evident here too, but all in service of the fruit. nice oak to the flavor, gives it a richness, and a light wine and vanilla thing in the flavor, beautiful with the pale wheat malt and the sugars in the fruit, its funky and sour and also kind of desserty, a little more left at the end of this one than in a lot of their beers, especially these small bottle fruited releases, and i love how long it lingers. more sour than others too, especially at temperature, but it all works so well together. epic expression of apricots in a really amazingly funky and mature wild beer, up there with the best of jester king, and certainly worth all the hype!",4.52

4861,Aurelian Lure,"I had this at the release on tap, along side Fen Tao, and later in the bottle. I have to say, on tap was better which is like saying the sky is blue.

4868,Aurelian Lure,"Had this alongside an O'so Arbre Qui Donne (which, just as personal preference, I liked slightly better). Hazy orange-yellow color with very little head. Aroma was very funky, with the apricot complementing nicely. The taste was tart and crisp, with the best way I can describe it as 'funky fresh.' The apricots were there, but the funky and tart, slightly puckering mouthfeel that finished not as dry as expected are what make the beer special.",4.34
4869,Aurelian Lure,One of my few perfect 5's. Better than Fou' Foune methinks. The scent is unreal. I kept sniffing and sniffing. The beer is sour but not an acid bomb. The interplay with the apricots is fantastic. Apricot is probably my favorite fruit in any sour. Truly a beer worth seeking out.,5

S: Sweet apricot, peach, funk, nectarine, tart, lemon, vinous
T: Balanced tartness, sweet apricot, peach, lightly lactic, hint of funk, lemon, oak tannin

While the beer is certainly tasty, it's less extraordinary than I hoped / expected. Lightly sweet, mild to medium tartness and a subtle acetic quality in the finish. Good stuff.",4.1
4874,Aurelian Lure,Shared with a few non-craft friends.,4.69
4875,Aurelian Lure,"It's amazing to me how much more attention these fruited beers get. This is a fine liquid, but some of their standard stuff has so much more to offer on flavor, aroma, complexity, and mouthfeel.",4.2
4876,Aurelian Lure,Slightly opaque golden yellow with 2 fingers of course chalky white head. Fruit is very apparent on the nose along with some back ground funk. Taste is dominated by minerality but the apricot is apparent on the back. Moderately sour that works extremely well with the fruit. Very clean finish.,4.31

4878,Aurelian Lure,"Draught at Jester King. Pours a hazy bright golden color with not much head. Funk, apricots, wholly apricots Batman, and some tartness on the nose; follows onto the palate. Light bodied. Finishes tart and dry with plenty of lingering apricot fruit.",4.5
4879,Aurelian Lure,"(From a 4 oz. tasting of batch 3.) Cloudy but representative apricot color, and the fruit comes through on the nose in a nice reserved way, and then the taste stays right in step with the pace and expectation of the lead-in. I'm not a fan of sours and citrus-forward beers, so this sweeter fruit theme is more to my liking and is a beautiful offering for the type.",4.49
4880,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"A slight fizz, but then no head. Nearly black, pours thick.

An excellent beer!",4.52
4881,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Pours pitch black. Very thick looking. 1 finger tan head. Head retention is good. Some lacing on the glass.

Thick, so full bodied. Some burn, but not a lot. Smooth.

4888,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"750 ml bottle into snifter; 2018 vintage, bottle #4949. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a small fairly dense khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a minimal spotty lace cap that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, and dark/brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of vanilla, coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, and dark/brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of vanilla, coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Very mild herbal, grass, roast, charred bitterness; and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, dark/brown bread/crust, vanilla, coconut, licorice, dark fruit, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a nice roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety/bready, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic, Minimal warming alcohol for 10%, with no lingering barrel booze after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged Russian imperial stout. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the minimally bitter/tannic/drying finish. Fantastic soft feel. Not as much barrel as I expected, but adequate. Fantastic rich malt complexity; solid barrel presence/integration, restrained fruity yeast, and mild earthy hops. Not overly sweet/heavy from lingering dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and impressive spot on style example.",4.25
4889,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Jet black with a dark brown head that retreats to the edges of the glass. The aroma is an amazing blend of bourbon, coffee, dark chocolate, raisins and caramel. The taste is exactly the same as the smell with the bourbon up front and the rest of the flavors coming in after that. There is a nice bitterness that lingers with the sweetness of the raisins and caramel at the end. Just a delicious stout.",4.66

4891,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,Really slick and tasty and does everything I’d want for a bba Stout. There is a nice caramel sweetness and the nose that really perseveres through the line. This is a sweet beer all things considered. But I appreciate the well constructed layers,4.28

4893,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"2019 vintage. Have had most of Lift Bridge's offering and found them to be good but not exceptional; Silhouette is the latter. Pours pitch black with some light barely visible at the top edge in my Spiegelau stout glass. Delicious meld of coffee and bourbon on the nose. Flavor profile goes together perfectly, not too much bourbon but the perfect amount IMHO and not too boozy but just right. Nice full body but not too much either. This is fantastic and given the choice of this or some of the better know BA stouts like BCBS, CBS or KBS I've enjoyed, I'd pick this over them.",4.73

4895,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,Pours pitch black with a medium mocha colored head. Smells great with notes of barrel present but not overpowering.

Black colored body, with slim dark brown back lit highlights. Partial finger head upon pouring results in a scenic show of rising bubbles replenishing the scattered islands and thin ring. Leaves behind a few scattered, small spots of lacing.
Aroma of dark roasted malts soaked in bourbon, which brings out smells of coffee, chocolate, toffee, and dark fruit.
Taste is robust and layered, with bourbon soaked dark roasted malts, chocolate, molasses, and prune. The coffee aspect is there but weak.
Medium plus mouth feel. Slightly oily. Good carbonation.
Very solid barrel aged stout, with balanced expressions of nose and flavors. Make sure to allow the beer to warm up to recommended temperatures. This allows for a fuller sensory experience. Really tastes like bourbon soaked prunes.",4.46
4899,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Outstanding BA stout. It’s got tons of chocolatey sweetness and a very pronounced, but not dominating barrel character.

Overall I’ll be making the effort to get this again, it’s great.",4.56
4900,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Very good barrel aged russian imperial stout. Doesn't meet the hype, but does not disappoint either. The body did meet the hype, with a roasty, thick, and boozy feel all the way through the glass.

Pours black and moderately thick but not syrupy, with very little head that eventually burbles up from below. The nose is a bit subdued, with cacao nibs, vanilla, red wine tannins, and malt balls, plus a tiny hint of black cherry and plum on occasion. Big bourbon notes on the tongue that amplify the aromas and provide some spice. Punching above its weight class at 10% abv. A nice, moderately full mouthfeel and boozy finish.",4.41

4914,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,(Most recent) Bottle courtesy of Brewzma,4.54
4915,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Pours a lovely bright yellow-orange color. Completely opaque, but it does avoid that sludgy appearance that you get from some of the NE style IPAs. Thick, pillowy white head dissipates slowly, but steadily leaving just a thin splotch of foam on top of the head. Lots of sticky white lacing coats the glass as the beer is consumed. I did leave about an inch of the beer in the bottle - that had a lot of sediment in it, so had I poured all of it in the glass at once, I do think I would have gotten that sludgy appearance.",4.4
4916,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Bottled 1-6-21, just over 1 month old. Hazy pale orange with a twofinger tight white head. Aroma is of tangerine juice and dankness.

4918,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Great looking and smells amazing. Taste is nicely tropical but a bit boozy and vegetal. Mouthfeel is warm, nicely bitter, chewy. While this beer improves as I get further into the glass, increasing my initial rating for taste, mouthfeel and overall by 0.25 each, I am a bit disappointed honestly, I wish the warmth and vegetal nature from the hops were absent. They decreased with time, but are still present. Though the beer is warm, it is still not hugely so, considering the ABV. Overall pretty good, but not better than the original King Sue.",4.25
4919,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"500ml bottle. Bottle neck is stamped for bottling date of '1-6-21'.
Murky, straw colored body. Two fingers of white head stick around. Widespread torn sheets of lacing. Some off white sediment chunks settle to the bottom of the glass.
Aroma is resin with citrus orange and pineapple.
Taste is mango, orange, and pineapple, along with the dank resin. Has a touch of piney bite at the end.
Thicker mouth feel, creamy, with some juiciness. Very good carbonation. After a few sips there is a hop burn effect on the tongue.
Has a sweet dankness that invites repeated sipping. Very easy to drink. Bold with hops.",4.53

4924,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Bottled on 1/6/2021. Poured into a snulip glass. It pours a murky, pretty, pastel color with a thick fluffy, milk-white head and abundant thick lacing. It's a beautify appearance. The strong, aromatic nose features lemon, orange, grapefruit, pineapple, ripe melon, and pine needles. I love the original King Sue but this blows it away. The lemon is tart and the grapefruit rind bitter but those flavors are perfectly balanced by the sweetness of the pineapple and melon. As it warms there is additional tropical sweetness on the back of the tongue and the resinous pine is more pronounced. It finishes with a hint of pepper and astringency. The mouth feel is thick and creamy with near perfect carbonation, and it's surprisingly quaffable for 7.8% ABV. I usually not a fan of the 500 ML bottle format but it works well here. Overall, it's wonderful to be able to purchase this gem locally and less than 3 weeks old.",4.68

4929,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"Hazy neon yellow body, white cap. Smell is huge with the pineapple, mango, grapefruit, and orange, but there is also lemon, lime, and melon in there too, dry hops finish. Such a huge nose I expected the taste to come down a notch, but honestly it did a lot, still fruity and good, verging on sweet, hops are very light. A good neipa taste but nothing crazy. Feel is bright and light while being very juicy, yet finishes drier, hop textures are soft but intentional. Much prefer the original",4.23

4942,Affogato,"Split the 750ml bottle two ways; chilled out in my fridge since the release. Not sure if some of the sweetness and coffee flavor was subdued by Father Time but, if it was, that only would've made the beer taste that much better to my pillow-soft palate. Heavily flavored stouts, especially big coffee brews, taste cloying and acidic. I was fully prepared for this beast to be over-the-top sticky and sweet but it turned out to be an exceptionally full-flavored stout with an incredible mouthfeel. I wouldn't reach for a bottle every weekend but, damn, I'd sure as hell like the chance to have it more often than once.",4.4
4943,Affogato,"Split 3-ways thanks Sam!
Pitch black with almost no head, a brown head dissipating very fast, even with a heavy pour head doesn't want to stay.
Smells a good amount of coffee, black chocolate, roasted malt, sweet vanilla.
Taste follows up the smell pretty much, smooth coffee, feels like drinking an espresso with a nice sweetness and hint of vanilla. Coffee with the ""Vanille française"" style.
What is the most disappointing part is the mouthfeel, it feels so watery, I don't really know why tho, I can't figure out how a 13.3% coffee, lactose and vanilla stout can be as light body as this, seriously it feels like I could just chug the whole bottle by my own.
I don't really know how to feel about it, did we had a problematic bottle? I don't really know it's the only one I've drank.",3.79
4944,Affogato,Massive thanks to Kevin for sharing this beast.,4.36
4945,Affogato,"Pours really dark brown with small mocha head. Very strong coffee on the nose. Good coffee notes on the palate, and the alcohol is well hidden. Slightly sweeter, but I didn't get the thick mouth feel that others claim. Didn't really pickup on the vanilla. Overall a well made beer, but a little overpraised in my opinion.",4.31
4946,Affogato,Nice and dark. Very thick. Very good considering it has not been barrel aged. Coffee and vanilla come through great on the taste. Smell is like a tiramisu with a nice coffee smell. Mouth feel lasts after and tastes excellent.,4.99

4950,Affogato,"Pours a pitch black with minimal head. Hint of vanilla on the nose. Not as aromatic as when you taste it. It's a syrupy sweet coffee. It's like dark chocolate syrup with a touch of coffee. Not overly complex. Not boozy, but it feels very heavy. That might be a result of the low carbonation. It is very sweet. Overall, it might be one of Trillium's best stouts.",4.21

According to my tastes still young, designed for the consumer who ""wants to take Cantillon"" but would then be shocked to hear an acid that is too strong.
Always to the eye you.
Smell that suggests that the Bretta still has to work (light mold and cereals).
In the mouth a very light acid, very ""salable"".
The best edition I've tasted of this beer is that of 2008 and I drank it towards the end of 2018: acid that definitely took off and made the beer more astringent and elegant.

Quite dry and with a champagne-like carbonation.
A unique Gueuze. Refined compared to other examples.

5020,Coffee Abraxas,"750ml bottle. No dating information found, but the label does read ""Coffee is delicate. Please store cold and enjoy within 60 days for ideal flavor and aroma."".
Black colored body. Initial pour results in two finger of mocha brown small bubble head. The initial head works itself down to scattered islands and a thin ring. Somewhat active surface. Lacing left behind is just a couple of very small spots.
Aroma has an anchor of dark roasted malts, and supplemented by cinnamon, chilies, cocoa, vanilla, and coffee. Smells warm and inviting.
Taste is a mellow dark roasted malts base, with the added flavors of the slight bit of chiles, sweet chocolate and vanilla, spicy cinnamon, and a correct choice of a specialty coffee. All of these brings forth a bit of char but very little bitterness.
Not more than medium mouth feel. Good carbonation.
I like the juxtaposition of the slight bite of the chiles and the sweet combination of chocolate and vanilla. The added coffee add on is a bonus, but does not seem out of place.
Taste is",4.45
5021,Coffee Abraxas,Abraxas has always been one of my favorite stouts without a doubt. I’m excited to have some ‘19 coffee on draft at Beer Temple Chicago.

5023,Coffee Abraxas,"I am drinking Perennial Artisan Ales renowned Coffee Abraxas brewed with Ancho Chili Peppers, Cacao Nibs, Cinnamon, Vanilla and Dark Matter Coffee, ABV 11.50%. This a big Imperial Stout in a big bottle. I am drinking from my one liter Disneyland Cup. It is thick, jet black, syrup like, oily, smooth, a creamy mocca head, coffee and pepper aromas. The flavor is mostly roasted malts and bitter coffee but there is also chocolate, cinnamon and vanilla, and some smokiness. Abraxas is an ancient charm with magical spells and this Stout is magical. You may think it is overwhelming and too much, like drinking black motor oil if you are not into stouts. If you like a big stout from time to time than it is magical with it's high concentration of stout qualities and flavors. It has a bitter coffee flavor but I should say it is not too much. There's no off-putting flavor in it, which is amazing considering how much is going on. I am drinking it fresh as suggested. It is a great big stout if you can take it.",4.7

5026,Coffee Abraxas,"one of the highest beers remaining on my personal want to drink list, so i was overjoyed to see it on offer at the brewery when we were there recently! its been one ive always wanted to try, and to get it have it, side by side, next to the original, was a nice a thing as i could imagine. after careful study, i have to say, as delicious and awesome as this is, abraxas doesnt need the coffee. not that i was let down or disappointed by this, not at all, quite the opposite, its stunning, but the original is the original, it has such perfect balance, and the dark malt in it does everything that coffee would, making the coffee almost superfluous, thus in the coffee edition they have to add so much coffee to push it through the grain that it seems almost a touch out of balance, or rather more coffee driven at the expense of the other added ingredients, not out of balance, the balance is still huge and awesome, i just get a little less from the cinnamon and pepper in here than i do in the original. the coffee is a lot, its bitter for sure, and it also has just a little acidity that kind of interrupts the smoothness the other one has. the depth of this is insane though, and in the coffee i also get leather, burnt wood, smoke, and chocolate, really compelling. it has nice linger, sexy warmth going down, and feels as fancy as it is. a rarity i feel so lucky to have encountered in this fashion, by surprise right at the source! as epic as this is, i still think with a gun to my head i pick the original. yeah i said it. still, this is as good a coffee stout as you will ever find. wow! worth the wait!",4.56
5027,Coffee Abraxas,"2018 vintage. Coffee is almost nonexistent. Either the base abraxas flavors over power the coffee, or the coffee died out quick. Still good, but to me does not live up to the name ""Coffee Abraxas""",4.16

This has a bottle date of 5/22/2019. Poured out of a 12/68 oz. bottle into one of my tulip glasses, this beer pours a pretty clear, fairly light/pale golden color with lots of streams of little bubbles rapidly and continually rising to the beer's surface. Has a very carbonated looking, white head that's about an inch thick when first poured that eventually settles to a thick, creamy looking, layer of surface foam along with a very thick ring of foam surrounding the inside of the glass. Good lacing here too. Aromas of some bready malts, yeasty esters, and Chardonnay oak along with some Brettanomyces funk notes that's all rounded out with just a hint of lactose. Flavor wise, this starts out with some bready malt that gives way to oaked Chardonnay white wine grape that has a nice tartness upfront that gives way to some yeasty funk and sourness, both from the grape and also from what seems to be some lactose as well as far as my tastebuds are concerned. All the flavors are balanced and compliment each other superbly. WOW!!! Has fairly crisp, also smooth, dry mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Also has a dry finish and aftertaste, and the sour funk really coats the inside of my mouth and my tongue nicely after each sip and lingers for quite awhile after each sip. Another outstanding American Wild Ale beer from the fine folks at Russian River!",4.55

Mouthfeel: Light bodied withca high carbonation
Finish: Very dry finish. Apple and pear fruitiness linger with some Chardonnay notes
Overall: An amazing sour ale. The Chardonnay barrel adds a distinct vinous character, along with some fruity apple and pear ftombthe yeast. Brett and lactobacillus adds just a touch of funkiness and tartness to counter the fruitiness of the beer. Very light, bubbly, and refreshing",4.35

5048,Temptation,"Bright hazy yellow beer with low white bubbles. Smell of white wine grapes and some lemon acid. Taste betrays the 7.5% abv. It is light and tart and delicate with just a bit of bread to balance out the citrus. An undertone of saturated wet oak fills in where the malt usually is balancing the tartness of limes, lemons, white pear and of course sour white wine grapes.

5056,Citraquench'l,"Citraquench'l is a long-time whale. I bought two packs today in Durham, NC. canned on 7/1/2021. Poured into a pint glass. It pours an opaque, tangerine color with a half finger of foamy, milk-white head and thick, soapy lacing. Its smell features bright lemon, lime, grapefruit, tangerine, and some delightful, floral notes. Wow, the taste is something else! The Citra offers huge, sweet citrus: lemon, lime, orange, pineapple, and ripe honeydew melon. It just pops. It's amazing that all this flavor comes from a single hop. The mouth feel is moderately creamy with near perfect carbonation, and at 7.1% ABV it's readily drinkable. Overall, Citraquench'l is everything it purports to be and more! It's absolutely delicious. One of the best New England IPAs I've had the pleasure to drink. Just terrific!",4.59
5057,Citraquench'l,1pint can dated 3/25/21,4.71
5058,Citraquench'l,Had on tap at Heist on 10.27.2020,3.95
5059,Citraquench'l,"thanks to Hopelessly0 for the trade on this one ... even with the can being around 7 weeks old this was incredibly enjoyable and flavorful , which speaks to the quality of this brew.",4.55
5060,Citraquench'l,Appearance: Opaque yellow-orange with a finger's worth of dense white head.,4.46
5061,Citraquench'l,"Look: Hazy and fluffy, this is a joy to look at. Wonderful lacing that lasts.",4.63
5062,Citraquench'l,32oz crowler poured into a snifter,4.28
5063,Citraquench'l,Bright hazy yellow with 4 fingers of rocky white head.,4.33

5065,Citraquench'l,Poured from a tallboy can into a Dogfish Head tulip,4.5
5066,Citraquench'l,"Amazing. This was my introduction into IPA's, and now I am hooked! I absolutely recommend this beer to everyone who is in Charlotte and loves good beer. All of Heist Brewery's brews are amazing though!! For sure one to check out!",5
5067,Citraquench'l,Canned fall 2016; drank 10/15/16 @ the Palace.,3.98
5068,Citraquench'l,Bought a crowler if this when I was in NC for a house hunting trip. Moving from CT I was anxious to try the best NC had to offer. It’s almost as good as any NE IPA from the classic stops. Well done Heist!,4.5
5069,Citraquench'l,Thanks goes out to russpowell for this brew.,4.37
5070,Citraquench'l,"Enjoyed on draft at Smoke and Barrell bbq joint. Juicy, creamy, smooth...enter any adjective here and it applies! Throughly enjoyed this even though smoky bbq might not be the best pairing!",4.71
5071,Citraquench'l,"A: The beer is cloudy yellow in color and poured with a short white head that left lots of wisps of lacing on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of grapefruit juice are present in the nose.
T: Like the smell, the taste has lots of flavors of grapefruit juice along with a touch of associated sourness.
M: It feels medium-bodied and very juicy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer tastes just like drinking ruby red grapefruit juice. It is very crushable.",4.4
5072,Citraquench'l,L - massive head atop a glowing orange body.,4.31
5073,Citraquench'l,"I unfortunately can't get down with 100% Citra IPAs much anymore (with the exception of Double Citra from HF - drool) - the overpowering qualities of cat pee dominate here; good to try though, and a great body for what it is.",4.22
5074,Citraquench'l,"From the tap:
Look: Golden orange color with nice 1"" white head; very hazy and opaque.
Smell: Hints of mango, orange, grapefruit.
Taste: Very tasty with hints of tropical orange/grapefruit, slightly dry with a little bitterness at the end.
Feel: Medium to heavy body; smooth and creamy. Lightly carbonated.
Overall: Probably my favorite newly discovered beer this year. Very drinkable and highly recommended.",4.67
5075,Citraquench'l,"Thanks to Mr. Beer_Economicus for this Charlotte beauty.
Pours a vibrant orange to golden hue. Opaque. Fluffy white head rises about 2 fingers in height. Scattered lacing.
Smell is bright citrus. Orange zest, floral lemon, and a fluffy oatmeal grain note. Very inviting.
Taste follows along. The flavor really does move in unison with the mouthfeel. The lite, fluffy delivery of such smooth citrus notes is quite satisfying. The finish is almost bitter, but definitely juicy.
Overall, a notable hazy. It is more nuanced hazy IPA, and I like that.",3.99
5076,Citraquench'l,"On tap at the brewery. Get there EARLY to get a park. My favorite draft IPA to date, smooth and power-flavors with excellent finish. Great staff at Heist let me sample others without asking. Highest recommendation! Also got some 16 oz cans for my homeboys as I live 259 miles away",4.97
5077,Citraquench'l,"Canned 07/06/18, so 10 days ago.",4.29
5078,Citraquench'l,"Crowler, shared with friends on 5/26 - Citraquench'l pours a light, attractive yellow-orange. It looks a bit like Tang, actually, plus carb! It smells fantastic - sweet and full of citrus.",4.58
5079,Citraquench'l,"Poured from a three hour old crowler. 
Pours a hazy yellow with two fingers of white head.
Smells of citrus, orange, pineapple, grapefruit, faint herbal notes.
Taste follows to a tee. Juicy sweet citrus balanced with a bit of grapefruit.
Medium bodied, super smooth.
Overall an outstanding beer. The best all Citra IPA I've had in awhile.",4.85
5080,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Opened with no hiss, completely still, no head. Jet black,
Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, some heat from the alcohol
Palate follows the nose, some hot peppers spice on the back end, lingering oak, bourbon
Relatively smooth but much thinner than expected.
The lack of carbonation isn't doing this any favors, guessing I'm missing out on the intended experience.",3.9
5081,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Good runner up to the Original Prairie Bomb. Pours a very dark, opaque brown-black, with a thin tan head. This stout strikes with coffee first, then chocolate and boozy-vinalla. Less complex Taste than the original prairie bomb, with a thick full-bodied mouth feel. Disguise the booziness more and your Prairie Bombs will go straight to the top of the beer cult classic list",4.77
5082,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Bottled 2016 (I think? It’s hard to read)
Consumed 4/12/20",4.46
5083,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. No date on the bottle, but I know it is at least a few years old at this point.",4.04
5084,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a minuscule tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with no lacing
S: Smells of coffee, a little chili heat, hints of vanilla, oak, and some chocolate.
T: Taste is chocolate and coffee with some vanilla, oak, light chili heat, caramel, and roasted malts. On the swallow there's more chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, vanilla, oak, and some slight lingering heat.
M: This beer has a fairly full and silky body. Carbonation is nearly absent but it works for the beer while the finish is on the drying side from the ABV.
O: Overall this is a fantastic beer. It has some great flavors and complexity which is heightened by the barrel aging. Alcohol is also well hidden as this one This is definitely a beer to be sipped and savored. I'd consider this one to definitely be one of the best examples of the style and definitely one to try if you can get your hands on it.",4.75
5085,Barrel Aged Bomb!,Picked up a 12 oz bottle from the Craft Beer Hop Stop7-24-19 for $12.99. No bottling date visible. Consumed 10/7/19.,4.43
5086,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Good but not as good as Bomb. I wish there was more bourbon and the mouthfeel was thicker. Good flavors but a bit muted. Glad I got to try it but at this price point (9 bucks for the bottle), there are better choices.",4.06
5087,Barrel Aged Bomb!,L: Dark dark black - no head to speak of,4.5
5088,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"This is simply a fantastic BA stout!!! Bomb! is super well-balanced, but the barrel aging process seemed to really bring out the vanilla in the vintage we tried, which can be a bad thing if it's not good vanilla but this seemed like high quality stuff. Wish I had more",4.79
5089,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"It would be easier for me to talk about the things that I do not like about this beer.
1. They are not always available.
2. While they do not age poorly, adjuncts fade and I have found that I prefer them fresh. The chili fade is particularly noticeable when drinking an aged one next to a fresh one.",5
5090,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Reviewed on 4/29/16, from notes",4.21
5091,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Great mouth feel. Nice smell of booze and chocolate. Pours a nice dark black, very viscous. Mouth feel is nice and smooth. Chile and vanilla comes through nicely at the end.",4.74
5092,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Interested and curious to try this again. Because I remember the first time having this (in 2016) noting that it muted the chili peppers and now with the 2017 and 2018 bomb! I have felt like the pepper quality has already been muted. And because it's only 11.2%? The regular is 13% and pirate bomb is 15%? What's the difference here? Let's see. Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer pours out looking like dark chocolate in color and forms a very thin caramel crown that disippated before I even got a picture. The first thing I notice on the smell is a ton of dark fruit. Raisins and plums dance around while introducing you to some barrel notes in the form of a dry oak smell. Very good smell but I'm not getting too much from the nose in the way of the regular bomb! So we'll see what the tastes brings. From the first sip the chocolate kicks through the curtain and steals the floor, while the dark fruit are supporting from behind. As far as the chili peppers, it's about what I expected. You wouldn't even know they're in the beer. I wish the coffee and vanilla were showing up a little more as well, but I do have to say that this is greatly balanced as far as the whiskey and barrel being present but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is thick and fudge like. It coats the mouth all the way through while providing a slight and well balanced warming sensation. Overall, this was a very good treat and I'm glad to have another crack at it. But it's pretty much what I remember from the first time. It's very good, but not great. I've had better barrel aged beers and it does bother me that this one covers up all the flavors of the original. Kinda takes the point away to me, I guess. It's a solid treat nonetheless, but give me a regular Bomb! and I'll be good.",4.34
5093,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Smell: Initially I get a good amount of spicy green chillies. a lot of chocolate. Dark Chocolate, milk chocolate. You get some Barrel notes, Sweet vanilla, toasted coconut, smooth whiskey with a hint of oak. Also get some caramel and dark malts that come through as well.",4.68
5094,Barrel Aged Bomb!,Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Teku glass.,4.34
5095,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"From the bottle, it pours black as pitch as coal with virtually no head. Vanilla, bourbon and alcohol in the nose. The mouth gets the same and more flavors as well. Great flavor!",4.42
5096,Barrel Aged Bomb!,Every sip tasted different. But every sip was phenomenal! Never guess this was 11.2 ABV! So smoothe. Caramel bites really make it. Bourbon not too strong. The hint of vanilla. I'm in love!,4.65
5097,Barrel Aged Bomb!,Very dark appearance with minimal tan head. Aroma is a nice slightly sweet caramel with a touch of spice. Taste is also a slightly sweet caramel with a little spicy heat.,4.52
5098,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Bomb is an acquired taste for me, but the BA version is dynamite. It mellows out the heat from the peppers and adds a smooth barrel finish. This is really a solid beer.",4.23
5099,Barrel Aged Bomb!,Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.,4.46
5100,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Poured into a snifter. Like most other big Prairie stouts, a black pour with a minimal tan head which fades to a ring. There is a pretty strong aroma- the Ancho chiles jump out at me, but chocolate and whiskey are there in the background. The taste is complex: there is a hint of coffee present, but whiskey and chocolate are most prominent, with caramel malt, vanilla, oak notes, and a touch of cinnamon following. The whiskey is extremely well-melded with the rest of the beer, and is present mid-palate through the finish. The chiles are somewhat muted, compared to the standard Bomb!, but provide a nice warming heat at the finish. The beer is full bodied, incredibly smooth the entire way through, and a touch boozy on the finish. Pretty incredible. Huge fan of Prairie's stouts, but this one surpassed my expectations and blew me away.",4.82
5101,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Viscous and opaque dark brown out of the glass. Prominent chiles and spices on the nose, with faint whiskey and cocoa. Not much coffee. The taste followed closely. Very similar to Bomb! but with an added dimension with the whiskey barrel. To their credit, this did not overwhelm the beer. Full-bodied and smooth on the finish. A nice improvement (hard to believe) to the base beer.",4.46
5102,Barrel Aged Bomb!,L: very usual jet black prairie stouts. No head.,4.75
5103,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Bottle:
Pours thick from the bottle, like many Bomb! beers I've had. It looks almost too thick to generate much head, which it doesn't. A thin brown veil of bubbles fizzes away quickly. A thin rim does resuscitate and fade easily.",4.24
5104,Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Pours pitch black, no head and thick lacing on the glass.
Aroma has vanilla, peppers, oak, bourbon, spices, cinnamon.
Taste is cinnamon, vanilla, roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, oak, maple syrup-ish sweetness, bourbon finish with peppers that sits in for a long time.",4.3
5105,Clare's Thirsty Ale,Part of the wonderful deluge of midwest goodies sent my way by @FBarber during NBS BIF #13.,4.36
5106,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"2021 release. Great smell of raspberry jam right upon cracking the can. Dualing raspberry and cocoa powder on the palate, with a shot of bourbon as a chaser. Excellent barrel character. Good legs for 12% ABV, but slightly thinner than expected.",4.29
5107,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Appearance - Poured into a sampler, the beer was a murky deep black color with a dark tan head.",4.29
5108,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Pours black with a finger of mocha head.
Smells of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla, light barrel.
Taste is dark chocolate, huge fresh raspberry, vanilla, barrel, dark fruits.
Full enough body, good carb levels.
Overall an excellent fruited stout!",4.6
5109,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"5/2/19 (Chicago): $12.47 12 oz. can prepaid purchase for January 2019 Haymarket brewery release, canned 12/28/18 and poured into snifter. Black pour, carbonation prevalent, tax head quickly dissipates living fine lacing. This release is 12% abv and labeled a barrel aged stout with raspberries. Raspberry aroma strong, nice balance with bourbon, overall sweet aroma. Taste mirrors aroma, raspberries are excellent, well blended taste with offsetting mellow but strong bourbon taste and roasted malt, tart cherry in the mix. Outstanding Stout! Slight fizzy carbonation, somewhat thin texture for a stout, nice and easy smooth drinking. Glad I poured this on a cold and rainy May Chicago evening.",4.59
5110,Clare's Thirsty Ale,2018 vintage (Jan 2019 release).,4.2
5111,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Pours a shiny pitch black color. Thick velvety dark mocha colored head dissipates slowly and only partially. A good 1/4 inch of velvety foam remains on the beer. Thick, viscous almost fudgy when poured into the glass.",4.46
5112,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"I'm not generally one for fruited stouts - adjuncts in stouts should be restricted to vanilla, cinnamon, coffee, nuts, and whatever that isn't a fruit. But, Clare's Thirsty Ale was on the top 250 for years, so I had to try it.",4.56
5113,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Pours an effervescent jet black with on finger of caramel colored head. So-so head retention & lacing, plenty of viscosity",4.2

5115,Clare's Thirsty Ale,32oz growler poured into a snifter,4.34
5116,Clare's Thirsty Ale,Very dark appearance with slight tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is slightly sweet raspberry. Taste is very smooth pleasant slightly sweet raspberry.,4.52
5117,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"been looking forward to trying this one for a long time and am stoked to have finally gotten the chance. this is a really neat and sort of unexpected beer, strange to name a strong barrel aged stout thirsty ale, like it implies easy drinking or high volume beer or something, but this is anything but, and it would take a special kind of thirst to want to drink a ton of this one. a rye whiskey barrel aged imperial stout with raspberries, and a wonderful one at that. i go back and forth on the fruited stouts, sometimes they get way too sweet and candy-like with the chocolate in the malt and the fruit sugars, but the raspberries are as tart as they are sweet in this, so while it has some residual sugar and raspberry jam qualities, its also really natural tasting, clean, and fairly acidic from their tartness. its amazing how forward the fruit is in such a dense strong dark beer. sure there is still plenty of dark malt in here, its intensely roasty with a coffee quality to it, and there is some barrel char and earthy wet wood as well, but the summery brightness of the berries lightens it all up and really defines this beer for me. rye is a smart choice for barrels too, its less sweet in this manifestation than bourbon would have been, and the dense slightly spicy rye character makes the grain base seem particularly interesting to me. light vanilla too, but it isnt desserty so much. dark cocoa, a little bitterness, and whiskey, along with old school raspberry jam in the finish, its just delicious and about as well done as something like this could be. this reminds me of an excellent raspberry stout i had from hardywood park a few years back but with the barrel, but other than that beer, quite original. worth the hype!",4.34
5118,Clare's Thirsty Ale,Thanks Ryan for sharing a mini growler of this liquid. Poured into a tulip.,4.69
5119,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"2014 vintage (Woodford Reserve barrels) - very nice incorporation of the base stout, raspberry and barrel notes. The raspberry adds a nice sweetness and jammy notes to a really well done BA stout.",4.37
5120,Clare's Thirsty Ale,Always tough to balance fruits with barrel aged flavor but this one is harmonious. Huge fan of rye barrel flavors already so this templeton barrel is right up my alley though I am not a huge raspberry fan. However this works. Nose is literally a chocolate covered raspberries with subtle sweet rye barrel notes. Dessert beer start with a little booze barrel on the finish. Great beer.,4.73
5121,Clare's Thirsty Ale,Black thick beer poured into a snifter. Minimal carbonation. Lots of chocolate raspberry on the nose. Bourbon followed by the sourness of the raspberry but wonderful balance. A little thin on the mouthfeel but minimally,4.71
5122,Clare's Thirsty Ale,Glad I tracked down a growler of this!!! This turned out to be as good as everybody says! Hard to get! They need to bottle this beautiful Rick chocolate and raspberry BA stout!,5
5123,Clare's Thirsty Ale,2016 on draft December 2016,4.25
5124,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"L: Pours a thick onyx and mocha stream with a 1cm sandy head and moderate lacing
S: Dark chocolate covered raspberries
T: Incredibly decadent - silky milk chocolate, cacao nibs, and ripe raspberries burst on the palate; the barrel is well integrated and provides a substantive base for the beer
F: Medium thickness with a velvety/smooth mouthfeel and ample carb
O: Man, this is dessert in a glass and well executed. While the caliber of beer is on par with Backyard Rye, I'm not sure I fully agree with the comparisons given the different fruits/flavors. Nevertheless, this is an elite stout and probably the best raspberry stout I've ever had. Absolutely worth seeking out - hope they offer this for growler fills again in the near future. Cheers, Haymarket!",4.79
5125,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Poured from a 32 oz growler into a snifter. Mild carbonation, dark brown with slight ruby edging. Big berry notes on the smell with mild barrel presence. Berry on the forefront of the taste, barrel is very mild. Smooth syrupy feel, alcohol is disguised well. Exceptional beer.",4.66
5126,Clare's Thirsty Ale,This is like a sweeter version of Backyard Rye. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night at a recent tasting. Certainly worth trying or seeking out if you are into fruited chocolate truffle flavors in your stouts.,4.58
5127,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Had a 10 oz pour straight from the tap yesterday. Looks like a standard BA stout with minimal head and pitch black. I can tell the base is a very solid BA stout, adjunct aside. This one isn't heavy on the barrel, and I don't love the idea of raspberry but it goes great this beer.",4.35
5128,Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Haymarket is the type of place that I assume existed more commonly before the craft beer boom; a place that makes awesome beer, but somehow manages to stay under the radar (possibly due to how close it is to Au Cheval and every other trendy restaurant in the area).",4.58

5132,Very HHHazyyy,"Muted orange haze. Nose is candy peach, pineapple, and whipped cream. Taste is super ripe peach, fruit gummies, melon, and a hint of mango. Ridiculously saturated fruit flavors. Soft but moderately crisp mouthfeel. Super drinkable. Wild!",4.63
5133,Very HHHazyyy,"I feel like I’m supposed to rate this good but batch 2 is not as good as batch 1 and the creation of very hhhazy kicked very hazy down a notch somehow. I can’t tell you why but very hazy, when it was 1pp and you waited in line 90minutes was better. This is good but there are better beers in the line up and batch variability is a motherfucker. Some King Julius is better than emperor Julius was. The first Julius I had in 2016 was better than either of them.
Weird shit happens. Anyway this is pretty good with a nice pillowy mouthfeel and a slightly over sweetened rendition of the flavors found in haze. A lot of harder edges are rounded out but I’m not sure that’s the best thing.",4.22
5134,Very HHHazyyy,"Canned 8/11/21 ""Be good to each other"" stamped on the bottom of the can. Some words to live by these days",4.52

5136,Very HHHazyyy,"I was really fired up to land this. Took me a while but finally got it. Don’t get me wrong, it’s REALLY good. With that said, Tree House has put out better. I was disappointed. But like I said, really freaking good beer!",4.58
5137,Very HHHazyyy,"The best iteration of the Haze family. Incredible color, smell, taste. The classic treehouse mouth feel is on full display here. A triumph of a DIPA. Delicious peach and citrus notes, low bitterness, a joy to drink.",5
5138,Very HHHazyyy,"Cloudy golden yellow haze. Pretty similar profile to Hazy. Juicy citrus and stone fruit flesh. Relatively mild caramel and sugar, yeast esters and soft carbonation. Medium in body. Has a very minimal floral bite on the backend.",4.63
5139,Very HHHazyyy,"Sweet and slightly malty, tropical hoppy, and hint of orange-tangerine nose on this one! Taste follows with a juicy-soft, slightly malty, slightly earthy and dry finish...as it warms, the earthy-dry vibes start to come out more. This is very soft on the palate...great mouthfeel! Fantastic!",4.41

5141,Very HHHazyyy,"Picked-up two cans at Tree House Brewery in Charlton for about eleven dollars. My one hundred and forty eighth brew from these guys. I had just gone to TH the week before, but when I saw this drop, I knew what I had to do. Lived up to my imagination, ridiculously good.",5
5142,Very HHHazyyy,"Canned 03/30/21, it pours cloudy orange color with a foamy 2 finger thick off-white colored head that was packed with bubbles of all sizes, dissipating very slowly and leaving good spotty lacing coating the sides.",4.46
5143,Very HHHazyyy,"Pours a very turbid, brownish orange color. Big, fluffy off-white head that really stuck around, and clung to the sides of the glass like Belgian lace as I drank it. Not the bright, orange juice color I prefer in my IPAs.. a bit ugly.",4.42

5148,Very HHHazyyy,"Pours hazy, orange gold in color with one inch head. Taste is big peach juice and watermelon. Medium body and carbonation, sweet. Wow this is good. This is super dialed in Haze with such a pillowy body. This is why I fell in love with this brewery. The creamy body is as awesome as I have had in a beer. No alcohol burn. Wow just wow. Best new Tree House beer in years.",5
5149,Very HHHazyyy,"L - about time. But wait, what about Hhhazeee? Either way, I've been waiting patiently for an amped-up Haze variant since the dawn of time. Meanwhile Julius and Green are getting every variation under the sun (not that I'm complaining). Let's dig into it. Pours a lovely, glowing orb of mesmerizing mango. Solid color thickness that hits the right shade of burnt orange, getting darker as we move closer to its core. Fluffy, pink-hued white head with tightly-knit bubbles, giving it a cream appearance. Dissipates at a moderate pace, but leaves a thin film of lacing that takes equally long itself to melt down the sides of the glass.",5
5150,Very HHHazyyy,"This beer tastes perfect to me. Hints of my very favorites, Very Green and Juice Machine. It’s got a crisp taste to the tongue like VG then gets very rounded to the roof and back of mouth. Strong hop that’s utterly smoothed out by the fruit. It’s like they’re flipping levers on all the elements to dial it all into balance. Don’t miss this one.",4.93
5151,Very HHHazyyy,"Very Hazy is one of my favorite beers, so when I saw this beer come up this week I had to make the 2 hour drive to grab the limited 4 pack. Poured the can into a nice broad tulip glass, the color is a dark yellow/light orange hue. Half inch froth which quickly disappeared. The smell is of ripe fruit, no sour tones. The taste and feel is what sets this beer apart. First sip tastes like grapefruit with mango/guava and then a clean slight bitter aftertaste. The feel of this beer is world class, somewhere between cotton candy and warm bread. The taste is soft and fluffy. If you get a chance to grab a can of this beer you will not be disappointed!",4.99
5152,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"Pours a clean, half hazy orange yellow color with a medium bodied white colored head that laces the glass nicely on the way down. Smells of sweet toasted malts, nice mix of floral and citrus hops at the end of the nose. Tastes of sweet toasted malts and a nice mix of floral and citrus hops. Not too heavy on either, very nice mix. Crisp, slightly drying, perfect amount of carbonation. This is an excellent beer!",4.5

5167,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"12oz. can served in a nonic. Canned 7/2/19. Pours a hazy, dull orange with a tight, one inch, bright white head. Nose is fairly subdued - subtle aromas of citrus, pith and biscuity malt with perhaps a kiss of tropical fruit at the back. Taste consistent with nose, albeit brighter and the tropical fruits notes are more pronounced towards the middle and a hint of herbal/medicinal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel if light-medium, with an easy, even carbonation. Overall, tasty and quit edrinkable.",3.97

5169,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"I have not drunk many beers over the last few weeks life has been topsy turvy. I am so ready to get off this roller coaster. Fuzzy duck, like the name of this beer, the can art is awesome. The beer is 45 degrees and served in a pint glass. The head retention is excellent. The beer's head produced a two finger thick frothy, creamy and airy. The head left lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 6 a deep gold color with amber hues. The clarity of the beer is hazy. Overall the beer has a beautiful appearance.",4.41

5172,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"Pours a true hazy orange with two fingers of khaki foam after an eager pour. Head retention is good. Aroma is papaya, orange, mango, guava, pillowy yeast and clove. Tropical fruits are pronounced and sugary. Flavor profile carries more of the same qualities, with papaya, orange, mango, tangerine and guava sitting on the tongue for a long while after each sip. Light notes of yeast, and bready malts round out the flavor profile, but the balance is still very clearly tipped towards hops. Mouth feel is pillowy and creamy with a medium-thick consistency. Overall, sweet, but overly so. It clearly focuses on tropical fruits, but refrains from becoming cloyingly sweet - a refreshing NE IPA characteristic.",4.28
5173,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"Original rating
L:4.5, S:4.75, T:4.75, F:4.5, O:5.0 = 4.76",4.79
5174,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"From a can, direct from the brewery. First impression was “this is no single ipa”. Tastes heavy to me, lush and potent. Bitter orange rind notes are most noticeable. good amount of bitter lingering... more than I expected. Finishes drier than I expected. There is a strong mineral character, an almost metallic tingle which, for me, takes over too much of the flavor. Here i was thinking this was a juicy neipa but Citra commonalities aside, this is a different animal. Im hoping it grows on me but it feels a bit “one note”. Im not blown away. Im maybe not as “citra-centric” as others so I shouldn’t be surprised that im not gaga over this. I see why people like it but... seems like a lot of hype surrounding this beer. My issue is that it starts exactly where it ends, it feels almost stingingly sharp with citrus... like your tongue is being zapped, but there isnt a depth to the experience... or a nuance to the hop profile... Again, one note. I normally really like single hop ipas but i think ive learned that citra does not have what im looking for, at least not when all by itself. All that said, it is excellent beer.",4.11
5175,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,"Poured out of a can into a tree house pint glass
Nose is tropical but not super intense.
Body has a NE style haze but not super dense like some of the juice bombs.
Flavor follows nose.
Nothing super intense. Definitely tastes more like a “beet” on the back end than a lot of these other hazies out there.
Overall very good but missing some of the density.",4.19
5176,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,An exceptional IPA that stands out above a sea full of IPAs. Love getting my hands on this beer. Love me some fuzzy baby ducks! This is a beer everyone needs to try at some point.,4.38

5178,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"This one was a jet black color with a fluffy brown head. The aroma was chocolate with toffee and bourbon. The taste had chocolate with some caramel, oak, and then a nice bourbon flavor. Nice creamy mouth feel. Very nice.",4.48
5179,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Pours a thick almost black color with a good sized brown head that lingers.
Smells like brownie batter and bourbon with notes of dark coffee and vanilla.
Wow the flavor really lives up to the delicious aroma. Rich chocolate flavor balanced with a good amount of the bourbon. Some nice vanilla, charred barrel character.
This is a very well made stout that is greatly enhanced by the barrel aging. This will definitely be in the rotation when I want a big stout.",4.84
5180,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Picked it up on pearl street in Boulder..The thing has about as black and pours like 10-30w. The smell is nice and boozy - alcohol and whisky. The taste goes where you expect, to the malty, roast, hoppy, bourbon booze place. It works. You can tell it's huge - nothing is hidden.",4.49
5181,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Purchased from a private collector for $17. This is 2016 vintage. Comes in a ridiculously huge 19.2 oz can. Pours out deep dark brown, gorgeous color. The head rises up a full 2 inches, but subsides to a quarter of an inch after about 30 seconds. The remainder stays for quite a while, a dark tan. Smell is a nice blend of burned caramel, toffee, chocolate, nut, and bourbon. The taste is rather incredible. Notes of raisin and cherry are present. As well as the flavors apparent in the smell. The bourbon presence is huge and rather dominates this brew. There is also quite a bit of bitterness in the wash on its way down my throat. Mouthfeel is lively and medium-bodied with a fair amount of carbonation present. Overall I'm quite pleased with this. It's a very sticky beer, but not overly sweet. Perfect for a nice night of music making.",4.53

5188,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"This is a dandy! I am a big fan of this style and this is the first time I have tried a Ten Fidy by Oskar Blues. It was part of a Christmas treasure trove of beers from my wife and mother in law. Merry Christmas to me! It has great foamy head retention and it pours an inky viscous black. The flavors blend beautifully, and although the bourbon alcohol flavor is prominent, it isn't overpowering and allows the other flavors to shine through. This is a really well crafted stout and I will be adding it to my list of favorites. Well done OB!",4.77

Very pleased. Smokey, deep, brown sugary & sticky tar-like in an oh so good way. Lip-smacking good & down home comforting. And the cool-chillness from being in a wonderful non-assuming dark colored alum can. Really this is simply perfect. Im not that good at being able to described all of the nuances in beer or whisky (though I GREATLY respect and appreciate those who do. It is an art to be able to...), but I know what I like and what I really like. I really like this.",5
5192,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Pours black with a coffee and cream colored head that dissipates steadily into a foamy ring. Light cannot penetrate this thing, it's a veritable black hole. On the nose, gobs of bourbon barrel, charred oak, dark chocolate, roasted barley, coffee, caramel and cocoa. On the front of the palate we're smacked with that bourbon oak barrel - so much wood and booze. The bourbon oakiness is followed by chocolate, roasted barley, smoke, coffee, burnt sugar, and caramel. It finishes with a bit of alcohol burn. This is the bourboniest stout I've ever tasted. Full bodied with a lot of carbonation for a barrel aged stout. Overall, an extremely well crafted and balanced stout!",5

5205,Mother Of All Storms,"On tap at Pelican Feb. 27th 2021 in a snifter. Looks wise, the beer is solid opaque black with a light tan head and a gorgeous, albeit thin, crown. The nose is incredible, roses, tulip, floral grass and clover, married with rich oats and barley malt. The taste is mollasses forward, sour caramelized apricot and plums, rich smoked cacao and cinnamon, raspberry tartness to sharpen it, roasted raisins and soda bread, ending on a long, very drawn out vanilla blackberry sweetness that lingers strongly against the palate in the back for up to 20 minutes. The mouthfeel is, obviously, luscious, rich, oily, and silky, while finishing a touch wet.",4.46

5207,Mother Of All Storms,"I was able to get in on a case buy a couple years ago. This is an amazing barleywine! Pours dark brown to black in the glass. Has a sweet front and backend and hides the alcohol very well. It’s a great beer to sip on the beach with a fire and watching the sunset. One of my favorites by Pelican Brewing. If you get a chance to be on the Oregon coast, this is a must see location for any beer lover! You won’t be disappointed with the beer or venue!",4.84

5210,Mother Of All Storms,I had this on tap. No idea of its strength until afterwards.,5
5211,Mother Of All Storms,"Bottled 11/19/18. Poured at 56 degrees. Fast fizzy tan head sits momentarily upon a deep amber/brown liquid; almost opaque with some clarity at the edges; no cap retention, ring or lace; thick legs sheet the glass. Nose is sweet dark fruit, malt, rounded alcohol and bourbon. Taste is prunes, sugary raisins, caramel and toffee; light roast malt, bourbon; molasses and oaky middle; no bitterness left from hops; boozy sweet finish. Some heat in the mouth with mild burn on tip of tongue; slick smooth feel; medium full body; low carbonation; face flushing warmth from 14% abv. Overall, I really liked this beer as there are intense layers of flavors, and it is port-like in sweetness, alcohol and feel; moderate plus malty sweet finish with plenty of fruit and barrel notes; highly recommend.",4.45

5213,Mother Of All Storms,"22 ounce bottle, 2018 vintage, 11-9-18 stamped on the bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a dark brown color with about an inch tan head that stuck around for a little while. There's also a decent amount of lacing. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like brown sugar, caramel, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, oak and dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, with brown sugar, vanilla, dark bread, oak, caramel, bourbon, raisin, fig, molasses and plum flavors. It's a little boozy, and with a nice lingering sweetness in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall I think it's a pretty good English style barleywine and a pretty good beer in general, I know I'd buy this again in the future if I get a chance to! $24.99 a bomber.",4.6

5219,Mother Of All Storms,"2011 bottle poured into a snifter. A hazy medium brown color with a thin tan head. Aroma was whiskey barrel up front followed by sweet caramel, toffee, and faint stone fruit. The taste followed thankfully. A rich, smooth experience of caramel and toffee malt balanced by plum and prune notes, framed by a restrained barrel presence. Full bodied and just rounded. A bit oxidized but this did not detract.

5221,Mother Of All Storms,"absolutely wonderful beer and one off of the long time wants list for me, who would have guessed it would take moving to idaho to find one?! in any event, its worth the hype and the years of frothing for one, a decadent barleywine experience with lots of barrel character, a ton of malt richness and layering, but not as over the top heavy and sweet as some of these can be, as it has a great maturity, lots of wood, some tannins from the oak, and enough barrel char and booze to keep it from being diabetic. pretty deep amber color with some head from the bottle, dense but not sedimented, and high shine in the right light. aroma is awesome, slight oxidation over sweet concentrated grain sugars, molasses and maple notes, some soy sauce, high end bourbon, vanilla, burnt wood, toffee, creme brulee, and a fruity mix of dried apple, raisin, and holiday fruitcake. the enormous alcohol content makes no effort to conceal itself either. the flavor has a ton going on too, sweet dates and molasses, a little more of the soy thing, lots of woody maturity and a ton of whiskey, vanilla and honey notes from it, some bitter char thats needed for balance here, and a whole ton of booze, but its warming me from the inside out in the most pleasant way. this is a monster, even if the body isnt as big as some of them, its a slow sipper and one to cherish and savor. i see why this has become sort of a cult following beer, its a prime example of the style and is wonderfully barrel aged. worth every penny!",4.26

5223,Mother Of All Storms,"2018-11 bomber opened slightly chilled. Poured hard to a tulip, which after tasting, should really be a chalice. Aroma of vanilla and caramel can be smelled two feet from the glass! Color is mahogany / chestnut brown, with a two-finger tan head that burns down to a tiny ring with scant lacing. First sips are full of vanilla, caramel, oak barrel, malty barley. The bourbon is very subtle but stays present for awhile. As it warms, there’s a bit more bourbon bite up front and darker malt on the back...not cocoa type of malt. Slightly warming. Mouthfeel is medium, perhaps a little thinner than Id like, but overall very nice. Five more on a shelf, so we’ll see how time affects them. BWIL!",4.64

5234,Sosus,"Pours a semi translucent golden color with a nice egg shell colored head, which if left undisturbed turns into little cream like dollops,A noticeable amount of sediment is present.

Smells like mild fruit loops,fresh grass ,some conifer.Taste pineapple bread like profile, the mosaic hop is definitely well showcased in a subtle malt bill, almost wanting a bit more malt. Feels medium body, finishes juicy.Overall a very good DIPA showcase beer. REVISION: 3/22/21, this beer is tasty but the amount of sediment on the bottom of a Teku glass looks about 2 Teaspoons. It sort of turns me off. Is it yeast? some hop pieces? not really sure.",4.02
5235,Sosus,"Canned 12/24/20. Pours a moderately hazy light gold, robust 2"" egg shell head with excellent thick lacing. Nose is dank, juicy, and hempy, even nearly two months. out. Tropical fruit, mango juice. Thyme, pine, poultry spices. Only the smallest hint of rawness from the hops deep in the nose. The taste is more subdued than the powerful nose; slight oily, spicy, resinous, and bitter notes throughout, even numbing like a sichuan peppercorn. Moderate juicy sweetness, but the hop spiciness is strong enough to prevent it from taking a leading role. Mouthfeel is typical - round and soft, light carbonation. I was more impressed with the aroma than the taste, but its spiciness was enjoyable.",4.22

Body is about average with good carbonation. Very enjoyable saison but maybe not as complex as I had expected.,3.96
5255,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),Batch 3. Thanks Brian for sharing. Shared from 750mL bottle into a tulip glass.,4.56
5256,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Yeasty, fairly dry, and a reasonable barrel presence - wine notes are subtle, but grapes can definitely be distinguished. The nose is just a bit floral and quite pleasant.",4.34
5257,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),This was the first beer I ever had from Hill Farmstead and boy was in memorable. What a great first trip it was and getting to enjoy this made it the best!,5
5258,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"750 ml. bottle.
Bottled 2016 06 08.
Moderate to vigorous pour yields a 1/2 inch white clear over a super bright golden body with some sticky lacing. Nose of funk first, followed by a bit of citrus, a tad of tropical fruit, and hay/straw, with some slight herbal/floral notes as well. Beautiful flavors of candied citrus, pink grapefruit, white grape, and finishing with grapefruit pith and just the slightest hops. Nice feel and overall, I know I waited too long to open this but, it's still fantastic! Cheers to Shaun and his crew for another world class effort!",4.58

5262,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"2/28/2018 bottle shared with 5 others. Poured into a tulip glass. Poured a clear golden color with a bubbly, effervescent white head that lingered. Aromas of funk, oak, hay and subtle acidity fill my nose. Not much of a farmhouse aroma here as I feel like the barrel aging did away with that. Taste is divine. Tart, oaky, subtle acidity in the finish. Muted layers of farmhouse here but not very prevalent. Feel is light and bubbly. Almost champagne like. Damn good. Overall, this is an outstanding brew. HF already makes world class non BA saisons and when you toss them into a barrel, they elevate to a whole new level.",4.66
5263,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"I have had Dorothy before and think it’s wonderful. This bbl aged, dry hopped version is spectacular and I am so glad I shared it with a friend who appreciated it as much as I did. Smooth and tasty. To be sipped and savored. My taste buds are overwhelmed. Yay HF",4.71

T: Even keeled citrus profile - grapefruit, lime, and lemon pith - complemented by a soft white wine note, oak, and that classic HF-style finish
F: Effortlessly soft and crisp mouthfeel
O: Another incredible saison from Hill Farmstead. Nicely complex profile with citrus, wine, oak, and a slight funk. Awesome.",4.75
5267,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Gold pour, hazy, larger head. White wine, grape, oak, yeast, slightly catty, citrus aroma. Nelson and citra hops give way to yeast, oak, white wine, white grape. Slight catty taste. Lighter body, drying mouthfeel. Stellar",4.6

5269,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Had onsite at Anniversary 2017, and it was amazing. So different than regular Dorothy, wouldn't recognize the association. Barrel Dorothy was golden and slightly opaque, fluffy lasting head, fruity, mild barrel tones, and smooth. Unbelievable, must try!",4.88
5270,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"This is a glorious example of why Hill Farmstead is probably the best brewery in the world. Complex layer upon layer of flavors, smells and mouthfeel that was simply amazing. I aged this for a year in my cellar and just spectacular....even better than when I had it last year.",4.96
5271,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Awesome beer, very reminiscent of HF Sue--one of my all time favorites.... Nice Funky Saison with citrus and grapefruit bitterness on the finish, with a kick of dry hops, very concentrated and delicious!",4.58
5272,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),Bottle shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks Brad!,4.66
5273,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Review is based on the dregs (last in line for a pour). Pours a cloudy orange hue akin to Sunny Delight. Nose expresses citrus, rind a just a hint of the wine barrel. Taste follows nose - a little little yeasty, but to be expected considering the pour was off the bottom of the bottle. Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild, even carbonation. All and all, quite enjoyable; however, I'd like to revisit with a proper pour.",3.97
5274,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Big upgrade over original Dorothy in my opinion. The wine barrel add so much complexity, and this was perfectly carbonated as well. Not a lot of bells and whistles with adjuncts and or fruit being added, just a beautiful barrel-aged Saison.",4.73
5275,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"This has a wonderful bursting lemon mixed with pith that makes this complex, sophisticated and easy drinking. A major upgrade from regular Dorothy. Great offering, almost in the realm of Art, Ann and Le Sarrasin.",4.62
5276,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),"Pours golden. There's a musty grape aroma, some tropical hops as well. The aroma is incredible and it carries through into the flavor and feel. There's good wine barrel presence, but it's balanced by the Hill mixed culture and the dry hop. There is funkified tropical fruit and some grassiness on the finish. It's amazingly complex, super balanced, with no component overpowering the rest. BA Dorothy is a phenomenally delicate beer.",4.67
5277,Bodhi,"A golden orange hazy color and a nice head. Smells like a delicious, promising blend of malt and hops. The taste is medium malt and some bitter hops. Some funk, sweet and citrus. Medium mouthfeel. Not too bitter. Good blend. Overall, I'm confident when fresh this is much crisper to taste. My can dated 06/07/21 is still drinkable and good.

Mouthfeel is glorious. Soft and pillowy with a slightly dry finish.
An excellent DIPA.",4.7

5283,Bodhi,"This one is damn soft. Almost like sleeping on the marshmallow man or Miranda Kerr’s bosom, these Columbus boys know what they are doing. Maybe they watched Saved by the Bell as kids because this one is straight up as West Coast as it gets. Pair this with a Double Double of beef dip from Phillipe’s, you bet I would.",4.77
5284,Bodhi,"Draft pour. Nice amber color. Very fine ivory head and nice lacing.
Aroma isn’t strong. Some citrus.
Taste is malty with some citrus and moderate bitterness on the finish. Hard to taste the alcohol but it does creep up on you.
Good mouthfeel. Carbonation was a little stronger than I would have liked.
Overall a quality Imperial IPA.",4.03
5285,Bodhi,"I feel like this was destiny. In Columbus for a drive-in concert during This pandemic we picked up some pizza and then hit a nearby grocery store for some drinks. I tried to find the freshest IPA that I could find and what do you know, they had one six pack of Bohdi cans in the cooler that was less than a month old. I wasn’t looking for a Dipa but couldn’t pass this up. Glad I didn’t because this beer is fantastic. So easy to drink. Love the scent and great mouth feel. I enjoyed at the concert and had a few left over that I have enjoyed even more. Not a hazy or NEIPA - this is a classic IPA with great hop feel. Some Malt taste but predominantly citrus. It will sneak up on you because it is so easy to drink. Love this beer. Love the 12 oz cans and will definitely be looking for more Wish I could find this closer to home",4.63
5286,Bodhi,"If you wanted a drinkable DIPA, you will find it hard to beat this. The first time round I didn't think this was a DIPA - it's smooth and you notice the Citra only if you know it. Before long it disappears as you keep drinking it only to make a roaring comeback just when you want to dismiss it. Probably not the one DIPA for me but it will be hard to not have it in the stable. Certainly a memorable version of a DIPA.",4.51

5292,Bodhi,"Gifted to me by @leperjim. Bottled 6/3. Clear dark bronze color, minimal head and lacing. Mildly dank sharp hop smell, little bit of pine. Taste is bitter and bold hops. Feel is crisp, clean, mouth watering and medium body. Excellent “old style” IPA.",4.53
5293,Bodhi,"Appearance: orange in color with a 1 "" head that slowly falls.",4.19
5294,Bodhi,Copper colored with a murky complexion. There’s a fingernail of dishwater white around the rim and covering the majority of the top. Light lacing is present. The aroma is of tangerine and pine. I’m tasting tangerine and citrus fruit. The mouth is very resinous and lightly sticky.,4.14
5295,Bodhi,"My buddy had been begging me to try this saying it is the best brewed beer in Ohio. We have similar tastes in IPAs so I decided to give it a try. It was a 22 ounce draft. The look is a nice dark golden color. The aroma is a nice blend of citrus and pine hops. The taste is the same. These balance of flavors mask the 8.3% alcohol content. Definitely can drink this down pretty quick and get a nice buzz. The beer is super smooth and has a nice dry finish. Definitely having it again at some point. Very, very impressed. May be Ohio's best IPA.",4.86
5296,Bodhi,"Received a single, twelve ounce bottle as a part of a trade almost a year ago. Looking through top-rated beers, and realized that I forgot to review. I did not trade for this, it was included as a bonus-brew. Not distributed to MA. Pleasantly surprised, very nice brew.",4.5
5297,Bodhi,"L: Dark gold color with a good amount of off -white head. The lacing is crazy on this thing, it clings to the glass for days.
S: Getting a ton of citrus and tropical fruit scents, followed by a nice hoppy pine scent.
T: Tons of citrus in the flavor and also some pine notes.
F: Medium-bodied with a good carb and a nice dry finish.
O: This one does not disappoint, super solid DIPA.",4.27
5298,Bodhi,"Bodhi is only my second of the Top 10 rated IIPAs. I am neither a fan of the style, nor the hype around it.
Some of that explains my low rating... and my tendency to rate extreme beers not relative to their style but relative to what I prefer (which is not extreme.)",3.99

5300,Bodhi,The best of the 4 beers I tried from this company. Hazy color. Tropical taste. Lots of papya and grapefruit. Finishes Crisp and juicy and overall good feeling,4.53
5301,Bodhi,"Bodhi brewed by Columbus Brewing Company, with an ABV of 8.50% This American Imperial IPA pours out of a 12 oz bottle into a pint beer glass a nice golden amber color. There is also a nice white head on top of this brew with a nice amount of lacing. The lacing sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with hop bitterness, a slight citrus flavor, with earthy grains and malts. There is a lot going on in Bodhi. So far this is a nice inviting brew, now for the taste. It is rich and bold with flavors. You first pick up on the hop bitterness with citrus flavors. The body of Bodhi is a medium to heavy but not to heavy. It is really hard to pick up on the 8.50% ABV in this brew. It goes down this smooth, the citrus flavors are a nice touch to this brew. There is nothing overpowering about this brew, it has a super nice balance to it. If you are a fan of IPA'S you should look this brew up. The mouth feel is Hoppy, Bold ,Rich, Clean , Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I'm going to give Bodhi a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to. Columbus Brewing Company, did a real nice job with this IPA.",4.18
5302,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Pours inky black with minimal head. Aroma of roasted almonds, chocolate syrup on the nose. Some vanilla and oak as well. Lots of chocolatey notes in this one. Some vanilla and oaky burn on the finish. It's not super sweet, but there's enough sweetness. It's lean and doesn't have the heft of the some of the thiccer bois you hear a lot about these days. The heat from the habañero burn is unignorable on this hot summer day and the idea that it's always stout season seems incomprehensible at the moment. This is a nice stout though and it's always cool to get a top 250 beer in distro.",4.21

The head builds slowly on a hard pour and quickly fades to a thin ring and tiny bit of lacing. The aroma is strong with bourbon first, then vanilla, cacao and spice. The taste is semisweet caramel and chocolate malts with big bourbon easing into nice pepper flavor and heat with the vanilla, cinnamon & cacao on the finish. Minimal bitterness as the spicy heat and drying barrel balance the big malt bill perfectly. The mouthfeel is full to medium bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, outstanding. This is a destination beer. So many things going on without being busy. No hint of alcohol as the habaneros & cinnamon mask what little might be there.

5315,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Description: Appearance is glassy and black with a small amount of dark, tan foam. Smell is deep and rich, with cinnamon and chilies dominating. Chocolate, vanilla and bourbon are also evident, providing for a complex aroma. The taste carries the same cinnamon and chilies, but they are extremely prevalent, to the point that the bourbon, chocolate and other underlying flavors are drowned out. It’s a hot, spicy and slightly bitter finish that doesn’t keep up with the richness of the smell. Feel is a little thin for a stout with low carbonation as can be expected.",4

It is reminiscent of something like a dark chocolate covered toasted brown bread with a dash of cinnamon on top. In the glass aromas of creamy vanilla and sweet cinnamon hit up front with a habanero pepper spice laying beneath, with rich dark chocolate, toasty brown bread, walnuts, oak barrel, some bourbon, caramel, toffee, candied dark fruits, and some earthy pine. The flavor is a blast of equal proportions. Rich dark chocolate, cinnamon, habanero pepper spice, creamy vanilla, toasted brown bread, walnuts, oak, bourbon, caramel, toffee, candied dark fruits, and some earthy piney hops to balance. Feels lighter medium bodied, creamy smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a real great bourbon barrel aged imperial stout.",4.9
5322,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"L — Pours a pitch black body with a scant half finger of light brown head. Minimal retention and lacing
S — Bourbon, prune, bittersweet chocolate, smoke, vanilla, caramel, oak. Comes across as a pure BA stout, not one with a bunch of adjuncts added.
T — Rich fudge, cinnamon, vanilla, toffee, caramel, vanilla, bourbon, oak, chili heat, dried dark fruit, hint of tobacco leaf and leather. Everything is integrated so wonderfully. So decadent
F — Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. More thick and oily than velvety and fluffy, but that’s ok
O — This beer really knocked my socks off. As a lover of this style of flavored stout who frequently finds the chili heat to be too mild, this one really has that perfect level of spice. Pricey, but you get what you pay for",4.52

Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, molasses, licorice, raisin, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Touch of booze in the aromas as it warmed, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, walnuts, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, fudge, marshmallow, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, habanero pepper, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark/brown bread; with light notes of coconut, molasses, licorice, raisin, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, herbal, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness.

Mildly increasing warmth of 12.1% and pepper heat; with minimal barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial spiced stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the mildly bitter/spicy/drying finish. Amazingly rich malt complexity, perfectly balanced spices, and bourbon barrel presence/integration. Not overwhelming on any aspect. A bit more soft and mellowed out on spice after the barrel aging.

T - while this smells, and tastes like a dessert stout, it is not overly sweet and. First to hit my tounge is light sweet coconut and vanilla, quickly followed by bakers chocolate and dark malts. There a good milk flavor. The lingering flavor is sweet vanilla.
F - what you expect from a 10.5% lactose stout. Viscous, think, rich, coats the tounge very well. Not cloying.
O - this is great! I love that the adjuncts do not over power the base beer and they all complement each other very well.",4.57

S: Smells of chocolate and buttercream frosting with some coconut
T: Taste is coconut up front followed by a huge smack of chocolate, light coffee and roasted malt before some vanilla and sugary sweetness comes in hard. Saccharin sweet on the back end with more chocolate and vanilla. Swallow is more coconut, chocolate, vanilla, and sugary sweetness.
M: This beer is right about the middle of the road on mouthfeel that is just slightly silky but leaning toward syrupy. Carbonation is low but adequate for the style while the beer has a slightly drying finish that seems out of place but works well. You'd think something that tastes like it has this much residual sugar would not be drying on the palate.
O: This one lives up to the hype. Really tasty and decent complexity that makes this beer an enjoyable drink. Anybody got any insulin??",4.75

5347,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Poured into a snifter. Jet black in color and viscous. It produced a medium-sized tan head which hung around for a while. A fairly potent aroma of milk chocolate, German chocolate cake, and spices. The taste was spot on. Silky-smooth chocolatey flavor with the spices described above. Impressively, this was not too sweet and seemed to have just the right feel. This is an amazing beer.",4.51

Strong sourish-fruity aroma of ripe red berries (= cherries, raspberries and cranberries), also notes of oak and farmhouse.

Refined and interesting, but still refreshing and easy drinking for its strength and age.",3.94

Note that only 2 of the 12 that I've had among the Top 100 Flanders Reds did I rate above each's BA average. As a malt-head, tart is OK. In the hands of a master, the style is better. In the hands of the masters of the masters that produce the style's finest, I have to agree with the high accolades awarded Caractere Rouge.",4.51

Color of deep red lollipop
Smell of red berries, vinegar, barrel, mild funk
Flavor is highly balanced fruit with mild vinegar. No single fruit stands above the other two for me. Not at all sweet or cloying as some fruited sours can be. I’m a huge fan of this style and Rodenbach does it better than most. This particular brew exercises subtle and experienced blending to deliver a balance above all others in its class. No beer can ever be perfect in my eyes but this comes close.",4.79

Smells absolutely intoxicating of vibrant, tart red berries and musty, old oak, with just a hint of tannins and vinegar coming through as well. Taste is a perfect balance of juicy, vibrant, sweet and tart red berry notes of cherry, raspberry and cranberry, with each really standing out on their own, and a strong barrel-character of earthy, old and slightly tannic oak, as well as some light, musty mushroom funk and just a hint of balsamic vinegar.

5369,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,"750ml corked bottle from the LCBO, served from the fridge. Best before date: 02/07/2020
I went into this so excited to try this beer. The look was a beautiful dark pink colour, and it smelled like a great combination of berries. That's where things went sour, literally. I know that this type of ale is supposed to be tart, and I was expecting that. Two other beer lovers tried this with me, and we all felt similarly. It tasted like red wine that had gone to vinegar. I have tasted balsamic vinegars that I would prefer to sip. I am hoping that I got a bad bottle, but I fear that it wasn't the case. It felt like it was well-brewed, but the taste was frankly revolting, and I have had some bad brews in my day.
100% disappointed.",2.03

Aroma of red fruits, nuts, fruit stalk, tarty, some barnyard.
Medium to full boyd, creamy texture, n ormal carbonation. Dry acidic finish.
Taste is similar to the aroma.
Absolutely great and complex. And Excelent aperitif.",4.76
5371,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,"Poured from fridge temp. Pours dark brown. Nose is cranberry juice, sour, and sweet. Taste is dark fruit, juice, a bit of syrup, and sweet. Really nice, but this had a few years on it. Might be better fresh.",4.06

Appearance: Very slightly veiled cherry red, Half a finger of beautiful soft pink head which dissipates quickly, Soft carbonation.

Flavour: Sour cherry, Tart, Raspberry, Cranberry finish, Dark fruit juice, Vinous, Yeast/Funk, Slight vinegar, Insanely balanced.
Overall: If you have not had a beer from Rodenbach - change that. In my humble opinion, they are THE name in Flanders Reds. Their beers are unbelievably delicious, complex and balanced. They are also highly consistent. As the name suggests, Caractėre Rouge embodies ""Red"".",4.44
5373,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,"If this was one 330mL bottle, maybe I could tolerate it more. As is, the sourness affects the teeth and gives acid reflux to regret. Too much.

5375,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,"What an amazing color!!..a semi-cloudy light strawberry color with a quickly disappating light pink head. Aroma is full, so full. of strawberries, light cranberries and sweet cherries. Taste has just a light touch of sourness from the cherries and a great balance of sweetness in the form of cherries and raspberries. Yeast and Belgian feel is so light and makes this beer so so drinkable at 7%abv. The tartness lays on the tip of the tongue and does not overpower the goodness of the main ingredients. Finish is incredibly refreshing and has a great feel of fresh beries throughout.This one is a winner !",4.2
5376,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,Bottle 3 of 4. Finally getting down to reviewing this legendary brew. Cork and cage 750 ml bottle and cost was a mere $8.70 CDN. Probably should've picked up another half dozen of these. A fine way to conclude Canada Day! Served cold into a chalice.,4.67

5383,Thicket,"blend 2, magic! the best of the side project little bottles ive had in years i think, its not as sour as so many of them have started to become, maybe its because its fresher, but the base beer is old anyway, so im not really sure. more likely its just balanced out by all this fruit, just an absolute load of the blackberries, this is fruit heavy as they get, and all the berries seem necessary to balance a rather intense and complex base beer, this is really good, worth the hype, although maybe just a little raw and unrefined in the bottle. its a deeply stained blackberry color, but has a lot of haze and murkiness to it, some particulate in there as well, looks almost like fruit skins, cant complain about authenticity, but the beer doesnt quite sparkle, even though its bubbly enough and holds its airy white head rather well. aroma is blackberry and blackberry jam, couldnt be more obvious, and there is nice tang and funk here too, lots of oak, red wine, light fruit vinegar, and raw wheat, really impressive and interesting, and the boldness of the blackberry is as intense as ive ever known it in beer! my mouth waters like mad to taste it. the berries are as prominent in the taste, crazy maturity, woodiness, and juiciness as well, even the less enthusiastic beer drinkers around our table are impressed with this. the fruit and the sour are great together, the complexity is enormous, and the fruit is sun ripened and real as can be here. not all that acidic, i could easily drink the whole bottle myself, which isnt always true of their beers, and the bretty part seems well developed too. great carbonation on this and some solid blackberry linger. one of the best ive had with this fruit, truly wonderful beer!",4.51
5384,Thicket,"Poured into a tulip glass. A clear ruby red color with a fleeting pinkish head. Scant wispy laces in the glass.

5387,Thicket,"Pours a beatufil purple with minimal lacing. Smell is of sour blackberry - sour coming from lacto, I am assuming. The blackberry is so strong.

Overall, it is probably the best blackberry sour I have had, but falls well short of smooth and fuzzy",4.34

Juicy blackberries, tart blackberries. Some oak to dry the back end and that signature SP tartness/sour to let you know it means business. M: Enough carb to make it palatable, but not a lot to make it soft. Oak dryness on the backend end. O: This is killer. I've had a few SP bottles now and this one is amazing.

5397,Thicket,Pours a dark burgundy with slight head that fades quickly and minimal lacing. Aroma hits right away with fresh sour blackberries and red wine. The taste follows the nose. There's a bit of lemon and some red wine vinegar along with a buttery component that comes through as it warms. Mouth feel is light to medium. Very good overall. Glad I got to try this.,4.25
5398,Thicket,"Pours a light reddish brown body with slight pink hues, half finger white head with surprisingly good retention time, nice lacing. Smells of tart lactic acidity, blackberry puree. Mild grainy malt sweetness in the background, but make no mistake, the acidity and the blackberry are the stars here. Although, the blackberry is certainly playing second fiddle to the lacto and acetic acid. Flavour is surprisingly less sour than expected, e.g. La Fosse, and the blackberries kick in towards the end. For the most part, it's oak, a bit of hay, a lot of lactic and acetic acid contributing a strong sense of sourness. The blackberries start to come into their own halfway in, and leave you with a mild jammy flavour at the end. The tartness never recedes but is rather constant. Still, it's a tasty beer and is far easier to drink than La Fosse. Overall, a very nice blackberry wild, but it lacks a good bit of complexity for the most part. It's acidic with a moderate blackberry presence, that's pretty much all she wrote.",4.24

The appearance was a hazy burnt yellow to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that quickly dissipated leaving some light messy lacing sliding right on into the beer. The smell takes on a quick sour grape to bitter grapefruit and then a subtle grapefruit, semi-sweet grassy contour. Beautifully floral and then a lemony sweet to bitter aroma. The taste takes on the same aroma roaming into a florally bittersweet dry aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the sourness to hit as a good penetrator for the harshness. Overall, this isn't a saison but a really nice American Wild ale.",4.09

I have a couple more cellaring, so figured to try this before the warm weather hits consistently. 2018 bomber poured cellar temp to a tulip glass. Nose is subtle vanilla, bourbon, light toastiness. Color is black, which pours with a three finger mocha head that burns fast to a ring with lots of lacing. First sips follow the nose, but with stronger bourbon, more toasty coconut,and barrel. Balanced impeccably. Slightly sweet with a full, creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol hides well, but has a slight warming later. Excellent base stout flavors.

This officially serves to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that not *everything* from 2020 was a dumpster fire.
Appearance is amazing, maybe because I was so ready for a beer, but few beers have looked better. Black with dark brown highlights and a thin brown head.
The aroma was malts and plums and raisins and more malts. The taste. I literally said “wow” - (I was so ready for this) just so smooth without sharp edges typically found in RISs, maybe the bourbon, maybe the aging, can’t say, but wow.
The feel, obviously IMO, but it struck me as ideal for the genre. Viscous but not too much. And I mentioned smoothness earlier, oh yes.
So glad they are in Michigan. Thanks Larry for this.",4.79

5467,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Thanks to foundersasap for sending me this beauty in NBS BIF #9
Poured into my 18th Street snifter.
Deep mahogany hued jewel. Absolutely transfixed by how this graces the glass. Cafe con leche colored head rises just shy of 2 fingers then slowly descends into perfectly ringed repose.
Aromas of warm bourbon barrel lead, not aggressively marching, more of a purposeful stroll. Notes of vanilla, roast, freshly caramelized sugar,brown bread, molasses, prune and leather all contribute to the menagerie.
Flavor begins as a bourbon-kissed RIS. It literally comes off as an old school RIS, toasty, malty, earthy nuances, but with that sweet-warm bourbon omnipresent. Sweet notes are of dark fruits-prunes, dates, figs, some cocoa and molasses. Coffee roast, charred wood, and a peaty earthiness comes trough as well. It really does represent the RIS style well with the bonus of BBA notes. Finishes warm and slightly boozy.
Mouthfeel is silky smooth. It sashays around the mouth, really inviting the entirety to actively commit to the experience. It finishes with a warm, slightly assertive bourbon ""adieu.""",4.4

Nose is vanilla, brown bread, leather, and what to me smells like brown sugar pop tarts. Taste is...damn that's fucking good. Pretty much what you'd expect from the nose but the thickness of this beer is pretty amazing considering the ABV and barrel aging. Some tobacco, and some residual sweetness really round this out.

The beer pours a jet black hue with minimal tan head foaming up and fading quickly to a thin edge layer.
The aroma is boozy! Lots of bourbon and vanilla and some peppery heat too. Rich dark chocolate and molasses also mix in but I dont get any hop presence on this brew.
The first sip reveals a thick body and coating sticky texture. Carbonation is mild, fine and gentle. This is a sipping brew! WOW! BIG physical traits here.
Flavor is rich and malty, with dark chocolate high cacao stuff, molasses, some burnt coffee and a bit of bourbon and vanilla mixing. The finish is sweeter with some brown sugar and bourbon coming through and then the warming booze comes in too. This is a big beer and it lets you know too.

T: pulled back a touch, definite funk and tartness but surprising mild, with a clean biscuity malt profile, followed by some hints of lemon and apple, definite hints of pepper as well, this beer sits comfortably somewhere in between a classically defined saison and a farmhouse ale, neither malt heavy nor funk/sour heavy, as it settles out, some of the tartness dies down
M: definitely dry, but with a fullness that lingers on the tongue

It’s big and juicy and citrusy, but it’s got a very strong bitterness that competes equally, so it achieves some serious balance. Medium bodied, almost an equal dry/mouth watering finish, subtle alcohol presence. It’s a welcome departure to the usual NEIPA, and it is an extremely great beer.

The overall look of the beer is very appealing, giving off this smooth, rich color of a thick, well-brewed IPA. The Flavor experience starts with the smell before even taking a sip, giving off a crisp scent that as you drink, will be surprised by the relatively smooth, almost creamy texture of the drink. For one that is more of a lightweight or for an overall non-heavy drinker, this beer is a great choice allowing for a moderate buzz with less. The overall taste is a powerhouse in your mouth. The only downside (And I mean the only) is typically the price which tends to be higher than that of a more common selection. It is definitely a party starter and great for special occasions.

5543,Ghost In The Machine,I have seen this one a lot and because of my part time gig at the beer store it is my turn. Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass bottled on 2/13/21. Pours a hazy yellow with a 2 plus finger sticky white head that leaves thick streaks of lace with amazing retention. 4.75,4.54

5545,Ghost In The Machine,"Nice looking dull golden hazy almost milkshake look with a thinning white head. Flat out orange juice nose on this puppy.

5546,Ghost In The Machine,"Hype machine was pretty dead on here, slight knocks for feel (could be creamier, more lacing) but all in all this one is great. All Citra NEIPAs are some of the best",4.37
5547,Ghost In The Machine,"Look: Pours an opaque but bright orange with good head retention and lacing.
Smell: Smell is dank/resinous with some orange/citrus.
Taste: Taste is similar to the nose: dank hops, citrus, grassy, floral. Delicious.
Feel: Mouthfeel is medium to thick with nice carbonation.
Overall: Overall Ghost in the Machine is a fantastic 8.5% NEIPA from Parish.",4.49
5548,Ghost In The Machine,"In a can, about 6 weeks old. Pours cloudy orange with a two finger head and nice lacing. Smells like orange peels. Tastes sweet at first and then bitter pith on the back end. Creamy mouthfeel. Lives up to the hype!",4.78
5549,Ghost In The Machine,Ordered this at a bar after the previous IPA ran out while on vacation. Was pleasantly surprised at the amount of aroma and flavor from this beer with a bright citrus flavor and enough malty sweetness to balance out the back end. Was able to find a couple packs of it at a local package shop to take home to enjoy. Highly recommend this beer!,5
5550,Ghost In The Machine,"Pours a hazy yellow with a thick white head that dissipates slowly. On the nose, orange with hints of grassy floral hop aroma.

Overall a fantastic NEIPA from Louisiana!",4.64
5551,Ghost In The Machine,"Tracked down a few singles of this one while on the Panhandle. This one was 2 months old, into a wine (cab?) glass that could almost work as a tulip. Pours a beautiful turbid golden orange, good 1 finger head, good retention and lacing. Nose is serious citrus fruit and maybe a little tropical, candied citrus peel, and a little orange blossom or something else flowery. Taste doesn't quite live up to the high bar set by the nose, but it is still great, though a little sugary to be ideal for me. Mouthful is full, a little soapy, and pleasantly lively with a soft but substantial bitterness. A little burn from the alcohol, too.",4.09

5557,Space Trace,"This beer is throwing me for a loop. Second time I am trying space trace but first time writing a review and it tastes more like FO than a chocolate coconut beer. Pours thick and dark with a good amount of carbonation for the style. Leaves a layer of foam covering the surface of the beer. You get an overwhelming vanilla note on the nose. A little bit of chocolate on the back end and a generally sweet character. Coconut doesn’t really stand out however. The taste is sweet and balanced and follows the nose with chocolate becoming more prevalent as it warms. A touch too carbonated for the style but not overtly so. Another hit from bottle logic. Nice barrel, sweet, balanced and utterly delicious.",4.78
5558,Space Trace,"2018 Bottle. Typical deep dark brown-black appearance with minimal foam around only edge of glass. Very nicely balanced sweet taste up front, with coconut coming out towards the end (and especially so as it warms). There's a good amount of chocolate presence here as well. Bourbon and booziness are well integrated also. Really good mouthfeel. Leaves the lips sticky after a few sips.",4.47

5567,Space Trace,"Coconut snowflakes float along the surface of this pitch black beer. Thin, brown bubbles quickly retreat to the sides of the glass. Aroma is coconut cream, chocolate brownie, toffee candy, and bourbon soaked oak. Taste is more bourbon forward. Its a big, full bourbon flavor that seems to be evidence of time spent in the barrel. Rich dark fruit, vanilla, and toasted coconut reminiscent of the best bcbs vintages. It has some roast and smoke to it and that adds character. Coconut butter cream frosting is the icing on this chocolate cake. Mouth feel is full and carbonation is on point. This is almost a 4.75, but I prefer to see the base beer come through a little more. This is excellent and well worth the cost to acquire.",4.62
5568,Space Trace,"Pours dark black with quickly dissipating head.
The aroma is bourbon, chocolate and oak. I'm not getting a ton of coconut, it's over powered by the chocolate.
Huge chocolate flavors with a strong bourbon punch, the coconut is there, but it doesn't really come into play until the finish.
The mouthfeel isn't as thick as I'd like and it's a bit over carbonated.
Overall, it's very good, but I don't think it's worth what it pulls in a trade. Wait for bottle logics hype to die down before seeking this out.",4.25

Full and flavorful, with plenty of coconut still present. My main complaint is that the fudge component dominates too much; it has a heavy, gooey mouthfeel and flavor that impedes the barrel characteristics. Still a nice beer though.",4.18

Nose is amazing roasty coffee and charred oak barrel. First sips are wonderful gustatory representation of the olfactory sensation. Coffee flavor is dense, heavy, dirty in a good way. The bourbon barrel adds a nice cut to the coffee, along with a bit of vanilla sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick and full, perfect for the way this tastes. Alcohol has a little bite, but it’s still very crushable for a big beer. I had to drive 3 hours each way to get some Jackie O’s BA beers, but it was well worth the effort.",4.84

5585,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"Standard black with a khaki head. Rich coffee, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and bourbon nose. Taste starts with the deep coffee, but then gets fruity with the raisin, date and plum with chocolate and slight wood before coffee takes back over. Given the rating expected it to be more dynamic and less aggressive with the flavor shifts but booze is integrated and hidden very well. Feel is dry, airy for style, not too warm or hot, and lightly roasted compared to the taste. It was good but overrated, many good coffee ba stouts out there that are more worth your time",4.04

5598,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,"bourbon barrel aged imperial stout with coffee, which on paper sounds like the same thing a million other breweries are doing, but in reality, is unique as can be, more concentrated and intense in all aspects than almost anything else in this field i have had before, which is a large sample size for sure. the coffee here is so fresh, earthy, and rich. its roasted like crazy, with an obvious dark chocolate profile that blends in beautifully with all the dark malts, which in this case stand out more than in a lot of these due to the apparent lack of a sweet malty middle, its all dry and roasty, near black, with the only sweetness at all in here coming from the bourbon, which has honey and vanilla and toasted marshmallow aspects to its sweetness, but its not from grain. it almost tastes like an ice beer, like some of the water was frozen out to make the beer thicker and more pronounced in the flavors, the dark malt here is really deep, and the coffee is dosed heavily enough to match it all the way through. there is a lot of charred oak on this, a faint hint of coconut and raisin right up front, and lots more chocolate. the whiskey is pretty strong here too, but it brings the coffee together with the wood and the heft of the grain. rich vanilla and maple notes in it, and just a little warming alcohol. this is amazingly complex and delicious, a hell of a breakfast beer, and another reason why i am increasingly obsessed with this brewery! this is one of the best of its kind!",4.5

a deep obsidian with a nice brown head of brown foam that subsides to a thick ring,
thin pool, and showcases nice light lacing. Nose of coffee, dark cocoa fudge, vanilla,
heavy bourbon, heavy oak, and moderately heavy char. Flavors follow but surpass with
presentation of bourbon and heavy char awash in heavy oak notes with moderate vanilla
and heavy coffee with char and crème brûlée brown sugar notes on the rear. Excellent mouth feel;
full body, slick, coating, rich, and warming with low carbonation and a touch of raisin bourbon note
on the rear with warmth. Overall, a FANTASTIC stout that was even better on tap and worthy of the
name Jackie O's.",4.49
5602,Tweak,"L - black as Dracula's night-box; great lacing, a bit of brown angry foam for 4-5 minutes.
S - sat on this too long; most of the character of the coffee is gone, still smells like strong beer, malt, molasses, and whiskey which is great.
T - more malt, whiskey, sugars, and roast, but not much coffee anymore. It is a 2017 (Oct) bottling though, so that's on me. Still fantastic.
F - Amazing mouth-coating, vein-popping sugar content, not for diabetics. Almost a marshmallow smore's kind of sweet.
O _ Baller stout. Just wish I'd paid attention to the date sooner so that I could enjoy more of the coffee-roast flavor and aroma.",4.34

5604,Tweak,"Bottled October 2017, my daughter’s BF brought me two as a peace offering so here go:
Pours dark brown with a slight tan head that disappears quickly. It smells a lot like a regular Bourbon County, heavy barrel, bourbon presence. The mouthfeel is a little thin after 3.5 yrs but that’s to be expected. A little evidence of oxidation but omg this is a big, boozy, brawny monster that’s had it’s rough edges buffed out. Vanilla, anise, barrel, bourbon, a little coffee that peeks thru here and there, it is superb and drinkable for such a huge beer. I normally advocate aging a beer for no more than a year, year and a half, but there are exceptions and this is one of them. My second stout by Avery and another great one, cheers!",4.45

5607,Tweak,"Bottled Oct 27,2017. $14 bottle. Beautiful dark brown with not much head, just a thin lip of khaki creamy bubbles activated in a thin centimeter around the edge of the glass. Scents bring on predominantly maple, touched with coffee, and bourbon. The taste is primarily sweet, and swims in delicious chocolate, maple, toffee, char, cherries, and as it washes over the palate the bitterness of the coffee arrives. The bourbon is there but not too strong and flavors the beer fortifying it with its alcoholic strength. Complements the coffee. Minutes after sipping my mouth retains the coffee and bourbon - it is an experience that lasts longer than a typical beer. Mouthfeel is medium thick punctuated by the tiniest of bubbles. Overall this is a complex and delicious beer. I have to say I’m a fan of the high abv because I love concentrated alcohol. Im a big fan of Mephistopheles and gave it a 5/5, and put some bottles away for special occasions. I’m going to have to do the same with this because I’m so impressed with the experience.

5610,Tweak,"Sampling a 12 oz bottle from 2016 bottling. Says 17.5% ABV on the label. Sounds like a winner for me!
The beer pours into my snifter a dark coffee brown color with no light passing through. A surprisingly robust fluffy to spongelike head foams up 2 cm and hangs around as a sturdy surface layer. Surprised there is this much head for a high ABV brew with 4 years in the bottle!
The nose on this one is....boozy! I get some dark bakers chocolate, black coffee, and a lot of bourbon and general boozy heat. there is also a bit of dark fruit, raisin and plum mixing and also some molasses notes. Definitely a big complex beer.
First sip reveals a lighter body than I expected and fine, gentle rolling carbonation. texture is kind of slick as it hits my mouth and slides down my throat too easy. But there is also a sticky coating on my palate after each sip. Oh and rounding out the physical traits, is some warming booze. This kicks in right after the swallow and lingers in my mouth and down my throat to my belly. Yup big boozy beer!
Flavor is malts and malts, I dont get any hop character here. I get dark chocolate and brown sugar up front. This moves to some molasses and bourbon in the middle and finishes with more bourbon. I think the coffee flavor has faded out over time. Definitely no hop character on the finish either.
This is a really nice sipping beer and seems just fine after 4 years in my cellar. I am amazed at the head retention on this beer which is still a sturdy surface even at the end of my consumption. very nice, would buy again!",4.41

Aroma of dark roasted malts and coffee. There is also chocolate, bourbon oak, and slight vanilla.
Taste is heavy on the bourbon barrel, but it blends well with the chocolate and vanilla. The coffee is more slight than in the smell. The front part of the taste is more smooth and slightly sweet, while the end turns more to the bitter/char of the coffee.
Medium plus mouthfeel. Quite smooth through the mouth. Good carbonation (the creamy head sticks around throughout the drinking of the beer).

Finish is smooth and sweet.
A lot of BBA stouts are over-the-top in the bourbon department. Not this one. Even the coffee is understated. Admittedly, this would be too sweet (and too potent) for frequent indulgence. But it's just perfect for the occasional indulgence.",4.54

Finish is clean and fairly bitter - none of this caramel stuff. Overall, a great alternative to the NEIPAs - which I love dearly, but every so often you gotta take a break. Hop Juju will smack you alongside the head.",4.02

5636,Hop JuJu,"Pours a light caramel color with a fine lacy head. Very light tropical aroma. Great big juicy notes on the front of the tongue - enormous hop bite on the finish with a great mouthfeel. Super smooth, all things considered at 100IBUs. Indeed, “a reckless use of hops”.",4.48
5637,Hop JuJu,"Hop Juju pours a gorgeous amber gold color with a thick creamy head. It has some serious carbonation. The aroma is equally fine. A great blend of hops and malt. The taste supports that great blend I smell. Supreme. It has enough hop bitterness to really accentuate this Imperial IPA. The mouthfeel is somewhat thick and chewy. The hops separate this from other similar beers. Overall an outstanding brew I believe I could get used to having around. Love the subtle differences in this beer.

5648,Hop JuJu,"Finally had a chance to try this iconic beer. As is the nature of things this beer is a huge credit to history and the early expansion of huge bitter west coast style DIPAs. Somewhat reminiscent of a Pliny, etc. Clearly remains an outstanding beer but now the bitterness and dank quality seem overstated. The creamy deep maltiness has a slight bit of a cloying and syrup. 10 years ago I would have marveled... now it seems somewhat pushy even a bit harsh in the aftertaste.
Can’t give a negative review but I guess for me I’ve just moved on. Have had enough huge pine and resin brews.... regardless of any citrus or malt contribution. Glad to have finally tried it.",4.25

5652,Fort Point Pale Ale,99?? Y'all are crazy!! Maybe I've become so used to IPAs and Stouts which give remarkable favours but this was kind of bland and skunky tasting despite the week old date. I got orange rind and dish soap. It has a creaminess that reminds me of Julius but its almost as is someone sucked all the deeper flavours out and left you with the base of a good IPA. I'd never buy this beer but it was included with a package buy. In concept a juicy pale ale sounds interesting but I think adding the haziness does nothing for the style. This beer does not live up to the rating.,3.64
5653,Fort Point Pale Ale,Nice looking beer. Thick luscious appeal. It has citrus elements and finishes dry and more bitter than one might expect from its appearance... but i found this to be a rather nondescript ipa... (and then i see its actually a “pale ale”... maybe all pale ales are just “nondescript ipas”?) Nothing outstanding. Nothing that I’d really think twice about. I was shocked to see the score of 99. My can was a month old so Im going to attribute its lackluster appeal to that.,3.92

5668,Fort Point Pale Ale,"Pours a murky orange that glows like a Dragonball when held up to the light. Snow-white foam tops out at just over a finger after a modest pour, and retains well. Aroma is orange, tangerine, papaya, and pineapple form a smashing, but not brutal or harsh, tropical fruit display. It smells a little sweet. Toasty biscuit, wheat, and bread malt notes help bring down the sugary citrus rush. Flavor profile is papaya, tangerine, orange, and mango with a hit of toasty biscuit, and bready malt notes. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a fuzzy, nearing-on-velvety texture at the onset and then thins out on the tongue. It has a middle of the road consistency. Overall, a flavorful American Pale Ale, although it really drinks like any other NE IPA just with a little more malt at the forefront. Knocked down 1/4 of a point for that. The malt balance here helps counteract the sugary hop pull most NE IPAs carry, landing this one at a very favorable balance.",4.38

Taste is very bright and hoppy, dominated sweet, juicy tropical fruit notes of mango, passion fruit and pineapple and with zesty citrus notes of grapefruit and tangerine. There's a light dankness and a hint of pine to this as well, almost no malt presence detectable though. Finishes with a light bitterness and very mild hop burn. Soft mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.",4.38

5679,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a thin dark khaki head that dissipates to a few patches with a slender ring around the glass; nearly still. Aroma of dark toasted malt, whiskey, molasses, mild dark stone fruit and caramel. Flavor is rich dark toasted malt, whiskey, caramel, dark chocolate and oaky vanilla. Medium bodied with moderate creaminess; light carbonation, but silky mouth feel. Wow, I'm a bit in shock. This was one a number of nearly ten year old stouts I found in the back of the basement. Most were drinkable, but all were clearly over the stage of improvement from aging. Not this one. I wasn't even going to review it due to its age until I tasted it. Although the near still pour was expected from great age, the aroma and flavor are outstanding. There is little or no oxidation nor other over-age flavors. The malt, chocolate and whiskey are all nicely integrated and fresh tasting. Whiskey is at a perfect level. I now wish I had continued to save this for the ""special occasion"" it was set aside for, this would have been an excellent bottle to share. I see that I paid a lot for this in 2012, but it was well worth it and now I wish I hadn't passed up other more recent versions due to the price point.

Unsure if original or based on aging...but what I thought was going to be a powerhouse instead was a gentle sipper of immense complexity.
Am I huge fan of Elijah Craig bourbon, and was delighted with its characteristic enveloping vanilla, caramel sweetness and strains of resin from the barrel. The chocolate comes through in both nose and taste. Hints of citrus rind bitterness and molasses.
Had an attractive color with dark brown an hints/sparks of ruby in the light. No residual head/lacing... as might be expected. No ABV and very smooth carbonation; very slightly syrupy. Enhancement not a concern. Gentle sipper, seductively sweet and delicious.
FWIW...agree with others..there are many many good BA Imp Stouts out there these days. And I also get worried when more that $1/oz.

O: lol. I looked at the can toward the end of my review and see there’s actual honey in it. I have a habit of not reading the label fully until I’ve drank most of it. Also not typical citra hop flavors. More of a sweet floral/herbal than you would expect. I can only imagine they used the hops traditionally, instead of dry-hopping the sh*t out of it.
It’s hard to think of this as an ipa. It’s good and hides the high abv well though.
This sweeter maltier ipa seems to be a Midwest pattern. Not a criticism, but just more traditional style. Would be cool to see a heavier hopped version.
Would recommend.",4.19

Pours fairly hazy deep golden amber/light orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a large cap that lasts. Thick foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, lime, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, papaya, mango, honeydew melon, guava, blueberry, gooseberry, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, honey, cracker, toasted biscuit, light caramel/nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness.

Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and no lingering hop astringency after the finish. Fairly crisp finishing. Moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium-plus carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy, and sticky/resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Mild increasing warmth of 9.5% After the finish. Overall this is a fantastic DIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/earthy hops, honey, and bready malt flavors; dangerously smooth and easy to drink for the big ABV, with the moderately bitter/resinous/drying finish; not overly aggressive. Amazing Simcoe, Citra, Galaxy and Mosaic profile. Extremely vibrant, juicy, dank, and earthy hops; with a nice sized honey and bready malt backbone. Minimal residual sweetness with crisp resin dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and outstanding style example. Loved the hop profile as expected.",4.23

Rich hoppy aroma with plenty of caramel malt, tropical fruit, and citrus. Nice sweet start on the palate with caramel, grain, and honey, followed by some more bitter flavors of pine, orange & grapefruit zest along with tropical fruit notes of mango and guava - great complexity! Full body, resinous, ample carbonation, alcohol is well concealed, bittersweet finish. Exceptional beer! I might have to get another can if I come across it again.",4.46

massive carbonation erupts from this even on a careful pour, I mean seriously this is bubbling like a muddy hot spring, this has lead to three fingers (easy) of white head with no signs of slowing down, color wise this goes down the yellow brick road (sans the lollipop guild or flying monkeys), not the usual color but that's ok, impressive hat on this one, and clingy like those annoying nettles that you get all over your socks when hiking in the Catskills (NY)",4.05

Aromas of sweet ruby red grapefruit, sweet citrus, candy sweetness.
Flavors are all citrus, grapefruit, guava, peach gummies at the finish. No heat, burn or harshness. Good balance of sweet and bitter without going overboard on either end.

S: Moderate aromas of mangos and papayas are present in the nose along with notes of oranges.
T: The taste follows the smell and has additional hints of pineapples near the finish. Little if any bitterness is perceptible.
M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation with a faint amount of crispness.
O: This beer doesn't seem as strong as it tastes as the honey really boosted the strength without leaving much in the way of traces of alcohol. It is very drinkable considering its strength.",4.22

Minimal carbonation and no real head or lacing. The cherries have surely mellowed over time but they're still very much present and seem to have a more earthy flavor, presumably from the addition of the Schaerbeekse cherries.

5781,Sang Noir,"Wow, I echo what everyone else has said about the beer. For me, its the taste of a very ripe purple mirabelle plum but brandy-like, with that farmhouse sour Belgian ale bouche at the same time. The bourbon barrel must impart the brady quality to beer. The smell reminds me of a tart mirabelle, not a ripe one and prepares you for the sourness. Dark blood ""Sang Noir"" sums up the color. This is not a beginner's beer. I am smoking a Montecristo No. 2 and the combination is sublime. Not sure if its the cigar or there is a hint of aged tobacco leaf in the beer flavor profile? I have some venison backstraps to cook and I think I am going to serve this with it! I'll update.",4.59

5785,Sang Noir,"750ml bottle. Caged and corked bottle. 2014 Project Vintage.
Dark brown colored body, with a cherry red hut when black lit. Slight tan fizzy head disappears quickly. No lacing.
Aroma of dark cherry fruit, along with oak barrel, with some bourbon barrel and a vinous wine barrel. The main aroma character is woody and dark cherry fruit.
Taste is sour, with a complex mix of what was in the aroma, plus a dark malt that almost goes to chocolate. Full of dark cherry, dark wine (port), and oak bourbon barrel. The end is rather dry, with the rich malt trailing off.
Medium plus mouth feel, and not quite a tooth scraper (because the sour is tempered by the malt). Good carbonation, with bubbles rising to feed a very thin ring.
The presentation color on this is striking and not often encountered, with the dark cherry combining with the dark brown. Smell and flavors are layered and many, but well blended in the end. In many ways this drinks like a dark red wine, but more sour. The higher ABV% is well hidden.",4.48
5786,Sang Noir,"Pours essentially like a wine - deep purple, no head, very mild carbonation. Aroma is predominantly a gentle, dry red wine tannin with notes of wet oak, macerated dark cherries & some very subtle bourbon caramel that adds depth. The notes were right on but I felt it could have been a bit more expressive.",4.62

The mouth is very viscous and smooth, which is very unique for a wild ale.",4.38
5792,Sang Noir,Full and barrely and lovely. Lacto tartness hides the booze beautifully. Blended such that neither the vinous nor the bourbon-y taste wins out. Closer to a classic Flanders Red than expected. Oh boy.,4.36

Flavors are heavily roasted, with apple and caramel notes forward, followed by heavy toffee, molasses, and bourbon highlights. Subtle ribbons of vanilla, chocolate, cherry, fig, date, and coffee dart in and out of the palate. Rich, heavy, and chewy in mouth, with a slick undertone. The aftertaste is a malt bomb on it's own.

F: thick and creamy, while soft and smooth.",4.62

5842,Vicinity,"A: The beer is very cloudy whitish yellow in color, which becomes darker towards the bottom of the can. It poured with a half finger high bright white head that quickly died down, leaving lacing on the surface and a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of grapefruit are present in the nose along with notes of limes and pineapple.
T: The taste follows the smell and has more balanced flavors of pineapple and lime with hints of grapefruit pith in the finish. Only a slight amount of bitterness is perceptible.
M: It feels medium-bodied and very juicy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This New England IPA is very juicy and really packs the in the hops in the smell and taste. I liked the combination of limes and pineapples in the taste.",4.28

Poured to a BrewDog stemmed glass.",4.59
5844,Vicinity,"Can. From Zombier. In Teku glass. Playing Avernum 5. Really strong frutality and bitterness, with some milkshake ipa reminiscences. Good but didnt live up the hype, as it is nothing that more accessible breweries cant do nor surpass",4.21
5845,Vicinity,This is a great NEIPA. Departs from some of the standards but is still a great beer. I appreciate the level of bitterness as it balances the immense pineapple and papaya that the hops give off.,4.48

5849,Vicinity,Crisp and clean but with some floaters too! Nice tropical fruits up front give way to a solid bit of hoppy bitterness on the end. Refreshing and satisfying double here that doesnt taste like a double.,4.44
5850,Vicinity,"Delicious. Smooth with tons of flavor. Fruity, hazy, with a great finish. Definitely not overdone with the alcohol content like some double IPAs have. To be honest surprised it’s a double IPA almost to smooth to be a double.",4.66
5851,Vicinity,"Pours a golden peach with a fluffy fast dissipating head. Aroma is big on mango and pineapple with a piney crackery malt note. Flavor is tropical fruits, slightly bitter hops, and a soft malt backbone. Goes down smoothly with a crisp finish. A well crafted DIPA.",4.31

Golden deep copper. Moderate head with lacing. Bubbly.
Bretty tart oaky nose. +Yogurt, vanilla.
Tastes similar to other SARA saisons. Definite tart peach or apricot notes. Tart, lemon, with a little funk. Minerals, yogurt, apples. As expected, more flavors keep showing up as it warms.
Textbook saison body and dry tart finish.
Very nice.
Follow up current batch #11: bought June ‘21. Just amazing saison in every respect.",4.76
5857,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"A: Pours a light pale/blond with a thick two-inch cap of bright white, sudsy foam. Very good clarity and retention. Not gonna lie—it kinda looks like a lager (at least the first pour; subsequent ones were cloudier).",4.49

I really liked this one - wish it hadn't leaked so heavily!",4.49

It is lightly tart, with lemon, pineapple, earthy funk, and floral. The feel is medium. A great Saison from Sante Adairus.",4.75
5864,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Has a very barrel forward nose, defined by leather, wet basement, moldy wood and yogurt. The interesting thing about this is, that there is a recognizable freshness, coming from the base beer, at the same time. It provides aromas of lemon zest, soft wheat and dried herbs, building up a perfectly enjoyable collision.",5

5874,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"good heavens this is good. thanks to drlovemd87. he purged his cellar this week and i was the fortunate dumping ground. he may have mixed up, because this is insanely special beer, and i am very lucky to have tried it. cracked the bottle knowing nothing about it, but was quickly impressed with its every detail. neat frosted yellow color to it, good white head, creamy and rich, but soft and delicate too, dreamy and sexy, cool. smells awesome, slight tartness to it, but some of that is the hop tropicality going on, funky brett, very mature and dry, with a bit of pucker to it, maybe a hint of some souring cultures, but a lot more brett than bacteria from what i can gather. lots of hops too, juicy and tropical, southern hemisphere and heavy handed. i get some wheat in the malt base, belgian pils, maybe some oats too, it has that fluffy texture to it. the oak is impressive here, maybe a slight suggestion of white wine, but here i get vanilla and sweetness from wet fresh oak, not a barrel of any kind. tons of must and musk and funk from the brett, an old school belgian type i would guess, reminds me of some cool old world saisons in that way. lemony as can be, but also pineapple, lime, and passion fruit come into the fold with the hops. what i want to savor and remember about this thing though is the yeast, i want it forever on my palate, i want to copy it in my homebrew, and i want every brewery who attempts to make beer in this style to try it, because this is what its supposed to taste like. unsure ive had one ive liked this much. great carbonation, crackling dry, and with a very special mystique about it in general. i want to bathe in this stuff. my goodness.",4.53

5879,Peche 'n Brett,"Copper colored with a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering half of the top. The aroma is of peach and a touch of brettanomyces. I’m tasting peach and just a touch of brettanomyces. The mouth is moderately carbonated, dry, and crisp.",4.22
5880,Peche 'n Brett,Bottle No. 26308 Best By: 03/2022,4.74
5881,Peche 'n Brett,"Pretty damn good beer. A masterful blend of tart and sweet in which you can actually taste peach instead of an indiscernible fruit flavor like a lot of other beers. Its light, crisp, a little dry, decently carbonated and has just the right amount of funk. Not the cheapest bottle but if you come across it, worth an indulgence.",4.37
5882,Peche 'n Brett,"This is magnificent. As it warms, fresh peach aromas leap out of the glass. The Brett aroma is apparent but secondary. On the palate it is more balanced. Still wonderful, but a tad more peach would have been welcome.",4.62
5883,Peche 'n Brett,"This is the Ghost Rider (a rollercoaster here at Knott’s Berry Farm) of beers for Raul. Bought a $20 bottle of 2018 vintage last month, but it gushed like hell so I drain poured it because of “infection.” Well, today I saw this 2020 edition for $12.99 and I decided “What the hell?” because it seemed like a goddamn sign and a good deal! (not that Raul is into that celestial stuff or whatever). Anyway, this one gushed too (but not as bad as the 2018. Oh well, I guess I’ll still drink it).",4.59

5890,Peche 'n Brett,"Excellent Sour from Oregon. Tons of peaches add nuance, some funk, but not overbearing sourness. Considering how high of an ABV this beer is, the booze is masked to perfection with a smooth finish asking for another sip.

5892,Peche 'n Brett,"L : Generic golden amber color.
S: Strongest smell of a beer. Leaks out immediately after I open it. The peaches roam far.
T: The union of peach and brett. The peach doesn't overpower the brett but still retains itself in the mix of brett and oak.
F: Light fizz with peaches.
O: Unique brett fusion with peaches. Good stuff.",4.87
5893,Peche 'n Brett,"Golden and hazy with loads of fast rising carbonation, and a half finger of white head.",4.44
5894,Peche 'n Brett,"One of the 14 beers we have had in one session of some bad-ass tasting brew.
Very nice one. The peaches bring a nice fruity freshness. The brett are a bit acetic but not overly. The whole thing is balanced, tasty and damn drinkable",4.57
5895,Peche 'n Brett,First time I had this it changed my perspective of fruited American sours. Explosive peach juice and perfect lactic balance. THe 2017 has been overtaken by brett.,3.9
5896,Peche 'n Brett,"L -- Pours an ever-so-slightly hazy straw body with practically no head produced with even a well aerated pour. Looks like cider
S -- Peach, jasmine, green apple jolly rancher, watermelon, bretty sourness, dryer sheets. Aromas don't pop out of the glass but are very nuanced and pleasant
T -- The peach really shines here and offsets the moderate (definitely not overbearing) tartness that is present. Also getting raspberry, oaky tannins, musky perfume, floral, quince, sour apple
F -- Medium- mouthfeel, medium carb. Nice and lively, an excellent warm weather beer. No bitterness and the 10% ABV is absolutely undetectable. Someone could tell me this is 5% -- hell, even 3.5% -- and I'd believe them.
O -- One of the best wild saisons I've had to date. The peach addition really brings everything together nicely. Wish it weren't $20/750ml, but it's worth it for special occasions.",4.54
5897,Peche 'n Brett,Very hard to believe this one is 10%. Super drinkable for that ABV. Nose is a rush of lactic sourness and peachy stonefruit. Definitely a tart one but not overly so. I'd grab more of these if it weren't super expensive.,4.44
5898,Peche 'n Brett,"Fresh batch (couldn't read date, but was just distro'ed)",3.62
5899,Peche 'n Brett,"Cellar bottle and have had fresh. Had been trying to find a bottle for many years, and the hunt was worth it! First a warning, this beer is dangerous, it tastes so light and peachy, along with signature saison yeast character, that the 10 percent abv is undetectable! So smooth yet has a strong saison presence in the mouthfeel. Bit of an aftertaste of multivitamin with the peach but not in a bad way. Very balanced, would be the perfect beer for a sunny picnic in July.",4.63
5900,Peche 'n Brett,"Hazy gold-amber with a large, airy white foam leaving a layer of chunky lace and settling quickly to a bubbly matt and round collar.",4.12
5901,Peche 'n Brett,Very nice beer. Carb complemented the beer well and it was very refreshing. The star of the show was clearly the peaches. They came through very well and worked excellent with the base beer,4.43

Smell - tart yeasty grain
Taste - fantastic nectarine tartness
Feel - light and crisp slight syrup
Overall - really nice beer",4.19

5904,Smooth,Foggy burnt gold with a fizzy off-white head settling to a thin chain in no time leaving a bubbling but clear surface.,4.2
5905,Smooth,"Really wonderful. Nice golden pale orange in the glass, minimal head. Smells great, like a nectarine peach orchard, deeply savory, almost like bacon. Tastes so great, just beautifully bright and tart and like eating a nectarine, incredibly juicy, so rich and savory, feels amazing, I could drink this endlessly.",4.86
5906,Smooth,"Slightly hazed golden orange with big bubbles and an insubstantial head, but points earned for good flocculation – no yeasty chunks even though I poured this like an idiot. All the gunk stayed safely compacted at the bottom of the bottle. Aroma is predominantly Band-Aid-ish phenols, some sweet, fresh nectarine, and a delightful apricot kernel/almond note with hints of creamy vanilla to round it out; overall it comes across as a farmyard funked-up peach melba. Tastes much the same, too, but more sour and less funky than anticipated. The 'whole fruit' flavour of the nectarines is amazing, almost like biting into the fresh fruit itself. Quite sour and quite fizzy; a smoother, softer mouthfeel would help carry the fleshy flavour of the fruit better, I think. But overall this is a remarkable fruit beer; the nectarine flavour keeps giving and giving.",4.3
5907,Smooth,Had this at a share with a few friends as we continue our quest to try all of the top 250. It is really good no doubt. I personally think it is better than Fuzzy.,4.9

Smell: Nectarines
Taste: Taste likes biting into a fresh nectarine with the skin on. A little bit of a tartness/acidy but mostly fresh fruit

S - wow, wow, wow. Straight sweet nectarine and stone fruit. Oak, and wild yeast.
T - follows the nose nectarine, stone fruit, mild oak and slightly sour. Luckily not over powering
F - effervescent light, dances on the tounge
O - incredible Nectarine and stone fruit flavor. It lives up to the description. I would easily put this as one of the better fruited wilds I have had",4.52

L: Clear/transluncent apricot and hay hues with a thin white foamy head
S: Tons of nectarines on the nose with a faint funk
T: Balanced and juicy stone fruits replete with peaches, nectarines, and apricots; very clean profile with muted acidity and a very mild funk - incredibly even profile
F: Moderate carb and healthy mouthfeel for a 3 year-old bottle
O: Phenomenal fruited sour from one of the best in the game; this held up incredibly well and with time the flavors really dialed in; hope to have the opportunity to revisit batch 2",4.66
5912,Smooth,375ml bottle poured into a snifter,4.34
5913,Smooth,"Hazy, golden, minimal head, just looks gorgeous in a glass. Funk, acidity, nectarine, oak come through on the nose and the palate. Perfectly balanced and carbed, and perhaps a little more sour than average for SP.",4.79
5914,Smooth,"Damn this is ridiculously good. It was bursting with stone fruit and the as usual the carb was perfect. I will say after having it side by side with fuzzy, that the stone fruit doesn't pop like the peaches in Fuzzy, but still amazing.",4.5

5919,Smooth,"375 mL bottle. Hazy orange without much of a head. Nice nectarine aroma. It smells of very distinct peach/nectarine/stone fruit. The taste is immensely sour up front. Oak. Strong stone fruit. Very juicy. After the sourness dies down, it has a little bit of nectarine sweetness. Standard absurd Side Project sourness. Makes it difficult to drink. Low carbonation. Very flavorful, but overly sour.",3.84
5920,Smooth,Huge upfront acidity while cold with a nice sweet juicy feel as it gets closer to room temperature. I wouldn't exactly call this a fruit or a tart bomb but runs a nice balance of both.,4.46
5921,Smooth,Notes from a recent bottle share.,4.67
5922,Smooth,Tastes like a slightly underripe nectarine. Impressive fruit flavor and quality. Bright. Acidic. Dryness on the finish. Clean midpalate that isn't malty/juicy. Fairly tart but the fruit and base beer are still presented well.,4.37
5923,Smooth,Looks flat but color is translucent golden orange. Smell is nectarine and mango. Taste is tart juicy nectarine mixed with oaky white wine. Mouthfeel is smooth but slightly undercarbed. My favorite Side Project small format fruit to date. Doesn't suffer from the yogurty lacto and sometimes extreme acidity of some of the previous offerings. Nectarine nectar!,4.8
5924,Smooth,Enjoyed at the SP cellar. Nice treat for a tourist.,4.71
5925,Smooth,"A real stand out at our tasting. So much flavor packed into this little beer. Intense fruit from the nectarines that comes off as a real juicy quality. Acidic and tart, but not overpowering. Very fresh and clean. Much preferred this to Fuzzy.",4.58
5926,Smooth,"This is the best beer that I've had from Side Project. This one is named Smooth since nectarines don't have peach fuzz, and it is smooth drinking. No chunks of fruit in this beer and it had nice clarity. Well carbonated and new CO2 always kicked up when swirled in the glass. Tons of fruit and musty farmhousey goodness in the nose. Almost like moldy or old fruit in the smell but in the best way possible - the farmhouse was distinct from the fruit. The taste is sour goodness, farmhouse animal jamboree, and fruit. It is weird but you can actually taste that it is nectarines instead of peaches. This is not as in your face sour like most of SP beers which I really liked. Would be easy to drink a few bottles by yourself.",4.96
5927,Coolship Red,Ruby red color somewhat translucent. Licorice and raspberry on the nose. Candied raspberry tart taste with some very yeast notes. Really pops in the mouth; crisp. Lots of flavors here. Solid beer.,4.59
5928,Coolship Red,"Very interesting and complex ale. First, this is definitely a sour. I usually do not like sours but this is definitely one I will keep drinking. The nose is a very light raspberry with a hint of yeast or fruit wine influence. It is a beautiful deep red color. The taste definitely has a fruit wine influence with a subtle bubbly or spicy finish. Overall a fantastic well made beer, especially if you enjoy raspberries.",4.5

Nose is dominated by raspberry. Also getting really nice notes of vanilla, funk, oak, and raisin. Taste is mouth puckering sour upfront. Wow! Tart, sour, raspberry, tree, oak, vanilla, yeast, and maybe a bit of sherry. The taste lingers on the aftertaste for quite some time. Such a gorgeous mouthfeel - somewhat dry.

5944,Coolship Red,"Been hunting this one for years. As Captain Ahab quipped, ""this is what ye have shipped for men! To chase that white whale on both sides of the land, over all sides of the earth!"" Beautiful ruby red pour that glowed in the sunlight, with no head after initial surface carbonation. Smell was the star: deep raspberry both fresh skins and sour insides, beautiful oak full of character, wheat, vanilla, wild flower, wild belgian yeast, apricot, and red wine barrel influences. Taste is way more subtle, but not really any less complex or beautiful, just wanted a little more bite like the belgian lambics do on the finish. Simultaneously vinous, sweet, tart, boozy and funky. Well worth the hunt, but does not compete with the belgian lambics of fame",4.38

5947,Coolship Red,"L -- Pours a lovely hue of red with modest clarity and a half finger of rocky white head produced with moderate pour. Very minimal retention or lacing
S -- Raspberry jam, raspberry leaf, tart apple, oak, bretty funk, lemon, strawberry, sweet floral. Beautiful and clean -- on par with the clarity of aromas found in Peche n Brett (although obviously very different)
T -- Largely follows the nose. The raspberry character really balances out the lacto-forward tartness nicely: it's not acetic nor does it just taste like a fruited gose
F -- Medium- mouthfeel, medium+ carb. Flies off the palate quite quickly for the style, which makes it all the more refreshing
O -- This is a fabulous fruited lambic, and one of the best naturally inoculated beers I've had, period. Pricing is very high, but it's worth it

S: The nose on this one is a lot of intense rum barrel with a little bit of alcohol. Chocolate, roasted malts and coffee come in at times as well along with the oak from the barrel.
T: Taste is an intense sweetness before the rum barrel comes in strong with that funky rum flavor we all know and love. Really nice chocolate notes followed by some roasted malts and espresso but the sweetness and rum keep coming back. The oak on the barrel is there but it doesn't overpower. On the swallow this beer is more sweet rum barrel with chocolate, roasted malts and coffee coming in at the end with a hint of vanilla.
M: This beer is big and silky on the palate. Carbonation is there but struggles to come through as more than a slight sensation on the tongue while the beer has a drying finish due to the ABV but it isn't bone dry.
O: Holy moly is this beer good. Great flavors and complexity with minimal booze and alcohol. It was apparent on the nose but it doesn't come through in the taste at all. This beer absolutely rocks the house and is a really nice twist on the standard beer. I'd love to see this one come back again.",4.75

5982,Fyodor,Brewed 1/25/2018. Had trouble removing the cork and had the resort to a corkscrew. Poured most of a 500 ml bottle into a DFH tulip. The body was as dark as Rasputin's soul with an ample tan head. Drinking in a 58 degree room everything got better as it reached room temperature. At first everything seemed thin with the char dominating but eventually the other flavors prevailed. Never specifically noticed the anise in smell or taste but lots of dark fruits and barrel were present. Mouthfeel was fine for a big stout.,4.29

5985,Fyodor,"Pours black with a finger of thin, large khaki bubbles. Aroma is toffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, and roasty and toasty malts. Bourbon adds a kiss of heat to the back, which is soothed out by oak. Flavor profile is really well developed, hitting notes of roasty, toasty and caramely malts with sugary notes of caramel, toffee, molasses and brown sugar. Bourbon is present, but not out of place, adding a subtle twinge of heat that works to establish a better balance. Oak and char add a little smooth bitterness at the finish.

Black colored body. Just a thin fizzy head upon pouring but this does not stay around long. Has a thin ring. Lacing spots have a tendency of sliding back down into body.
Aroma of roasted malts, dark currant/cherry fruit, coffee, and spice.
Taste is dark roasted malts, faint coffee, dark chocolate, and a swirl of barrel notes (oak wood, smoke, and vanilla). Suggested is dark cherry fruit, black licorice, and other spices such as anise.
Fuller mouth feel. Lower carbonation.
A beer that is super dark in the glass, and expresses a complex profile of malts, fruit, chocolate, coffee, and spices , but is super smooth and has very little bitterness (it does has some sourness).

“BREWED JANUARY 25, 2018” at top of rear label. Stored at 42 degrees and served at 54 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.
Appearance – 5.
Body – Dark brown/black, opaque.
Head – Large (Maximum 6.3 cm, aggressive center pour), tan, medium density and rocky, average retention, diminishing to an irregular three to five mm ring and a rocky partial layer. Head retraction leaves behind thick, wide bands of lacing as well as isolated islands.
Lacing – Excellent. This produces marked three-dimensional bands of lacing, consisting almost exclusively of tiny bubbles. Rings are connected by thin columns.
First pour – Dark brown, clear.
Aroma – 4.25 - Initially sweet chocolate and roasted malt with some “dark fruit”, shifting to wood. Wood remains the predominant odor for the remainder of the serving, although some bourbon appears as it further warms.
Flavor – 4.25 - Begins with light chocolate flavor followed by a bit of caramel and some “dark fruit”. Allowing it to warm in my mouth allows the alcohol (13.5% ABV) flavor to stampede forth. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide, no hops.
Palate – 4 – Full, creamy, soft carbonation.
Impression and interpretation – 4.25 – Overall, a very attractive and aromatic brew, with the appearance approaching perfection for a Russian Imperial Stout. The nose is complex and exciting while the taste also demonstrates more complexity than I can articulate – I will leave this to someone with better taste buds. Overall, just one damn good brew!",4.27

6008,Black & Wild,"Was surprised that I got to try this beer. Batch 1, shared at the SP Brewery 1 year anniversary. Pours a dark reddish hue, with not a ton of carb. I didn't pick up on much more than the cherry on the nose. Flavor was pretty intense, which was a bit of a surprise given the age of the bottle. A nice robust tart cherry flavor on the palate. I didn't get a lot of the barrel, but that could've been from all the other insane beers I was having at the time.",4.38

It's taste is sublime; funky, oaky white wine grape with soft notes of peach that sweeten the Brettanomyces and native Missouri microflora. It's so delicate and fine. It has the expected effervescence and it doesn't drink like 10% ABV. Overall, Blanc De Blancs is an absolute delight. I'm privileged to have had the chance to try it.",4.49
6028,Blanc De Blancs,Poured from a 375 into an SP durobar glass. Color was vibrant yellow/orange with not much haze once dregs were poured. Aroma was unripened green grape peel and chardonnay.

6032,Blanc De Blancs,"Pours foggy golden orange that drops to a murky transparency when the last of the bottle is poured into the glass. Head is near null with only a bit of fizz rising to the top and disappearing - akin to a glass of Champagne. Aroma is dry green grapes, tart green apple and lemon zest in a white wine, champagne-esque display. Light sour twist to it. Flavor profile continues the tart green apple and dry green grape story-line. Interwoven are notes of lemon zest, cellar stone, grapefruit and peach. Finish is lightly sour, with light-bodied, citrus sugary notes lingering long after the finish. Mouth feel is characterized by a moderately soft effervescence that only opens up after the initial sharp, energized effervescence decays. It has a medium, middle of the road, consistency. Overall, very unique. Lightbodied sourness mingles with dry green grapes and tart green apple to form a beer styled after champagne and white wine.",4.16

6034,Blanc De Blancs,"Acts exactly like champagne. Foams up immediately, recedes quickly, bubbles rising from nucleation sites on the bottom of the glass. Crazy musty aromas, with a Moscato-like sweetness. Between the musty funk and sweet white wine aromas, the jaw-aching tartness from the first sip is a bit of a shock. The 10% is front and center with tons of white wine, funk, barrel, and a dry as a bone finish.",4.05

6036,Blanc De Blancs,"Copper colored, hazy, and with no real head. The aroma is of very forward oak and chardonnel grapes. I'm tasting the chardonnel grapes, oak, and very tart microflora. There's nothing subtle about the aggressiveness of the flavors here. The mouth is bone dry, lightly acidic, and offers moderate carbonation.",4.26
6037,Blanc De Blancs,"Aroma is complex and very, very intense in aroma. Super funky aroma with breadiness, grape must etc. It's quite spectacular. Taste comes off moderate to high sour scale, high acidity, and a little bit boozy. Sweet as well blended with the sour. Not quite as funky in the taste as in the aroma. Feel is quite interesting as the sweet/sour taste you'd expect a cloying syrupiness in the back of your throat but it finishes very clean. Gets high marks for that.",4.71

6057,Caffè Americano,"Pours black with a finger of motor oil and caramel colored head. It looks dense and sticky, clinging to the glass after each swirl. Aroma is rich caramel, toffee and dark chocolate with roasty coffee and roasty and toasty malts. Whiskey spices up the back end with a little chary bitterness to round it out. It smells dense and hearty. Flavor profile is toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate and roasty coffee with roasty, toasty, caramely malts. It's rich and dense, jam-packed with flavor. Bourbon adds a touch more depth and balance without adding much heat. Char closes it out, adding a little more bitterness. Mouth feel is dense, thick and chewy. Overall, dense and chewy stout jam packed with coffee and some bourbon. It's a boozy breakfast in a bottle.",4.5
6058,Caffè Americano,Pours a deep dark brown with beige edges and a half finger of fluffy tan head. The nose is reminiscent of coffee with cream. The flavor follows the nose with more than a touch of sweetness on the finish. The mouthfeel is sticky.,4.21
6059,Caffè Americano,"On tap:
Well, there’s a big espresso component to this beer, and the vanilla plays accent to the bold coffee notes. It also stays away from being too sweet, though it’s not dry either.",4.46
6060,Caffè Americano,Pours a thick dark brown. Forms a finger of dark brown head. Nice creamy look to it. Good retention as well.,4.29
6061,Caffè Americano,Rich and balanced imperial stout we've got here. Nothing goes over another element. It's relatively complex and thickly smooth. An enjoyable brew to replace coffee after sunday lunch,4.5
6062,Caffè Americano,"L - Pitch, opaque black with a thin dark tan head that dissipates quickly leaving behind no head.
S - Rich roasted, bitter espresso and coffee along with dark chocolate and roasted/toasted grains
T - Complex but follows the nose: Rich, roasted, bitter espresso and coffee up front and throughout along with notes of dark chocolate, and a slight hint of sweetness from the vanilla at the end. Fudge - very rich. Molasses and charred wood/smoke. Roasted and toasted malts/oats throughout.
F - Full bodied with a light to moderate amount of carbonation. Somewhat thick and oily but smooth. Somewhat leans more towards the medium end of the spectrum in terms of body.

At first, the combination of roasted barley, somewhat bitter coffee and subtle sweet shadings of vanilla blend, giving the beer an interesting roll-out. After a few sips, the bitterness takes over, which makes the beer one-note. Solid yes, but I'm surprised by the world class rating.",3.75

6068,Caffè Americano,Pumped to find this for 6 bucks at a giant eagle on the way to a concert. Color on fleek deep dark toxic black thick and viscous with a 1/2 inch of froth.

Body is heavy of course and abv is a bit harsh.,4.32
6069,Caffè Americano,"Pours pitch black, nice mocha head. Huge espresso aroma. Massive coffee flavor, nice dose of chocolate,, touch of coffee bitterness, and a sweet vanilla finish. Carbonation adds to a creamy texture. Overall a big surprise from CC. World class beer here.",4.5

6071,Caffè Americano,"Bottled 02/19/19, it pours as black as ink with a 1-2 finger thick brown head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating slowly and leaving minimal spotty lacing. It was surprising to see such little head retention.",4.52

6073,Caffè Americano,"Growler into pint glass. Pours a dark dark brown with a minimal darak tan head. Initial impression is expresso, chocolate, booze, vanilla, maybe a touch of molasses, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth; carbonation is minimal. Finish is oily-smooth and yet conveys a warning note of the substantial ABV.
Cigar City makes some good stuff. Their stouts have, in my experience, been consistently excellent. Here's another one.",4.38
6074,Caffè Americano,"Excited to have this one after hearing about it for so long, and it did not disappoint. Foreboding opaque black with a thin oatmeal colored head. Smell hits all the right notes: espresso, huge chocolate, vanilla, barley and smooth malt. The tastes is dark and powerfully creamy, the chocolate is heavy, the espresso lifts with the vanilla, there is some nuts and caramel under the surface, and the malts don't come across as super roasted, rather they are smooth and super heavy. This beer sits in the gut like a brick, but the body is creamy, somewhat airy, and frothy",4.5
6075,Caffè Americano,"Poured a black body with one-finger head khaki head with minor lace. Mild espresso aroma of roasted coffee with some hints of lactic quality. Smooth, thick, heavy, easy to drink, well-hidden ABV, slightly cocoa sweet and roasted (and slightly sticky) coffee taste and so easy to drink. Well-balanced beer that is a must-try.",4.2
6076,Caffè Americano,"Pretty much exactly as advertised: a big coffee stout with complementary notes of chocolate and vanilla. Thick and viscous in the glass, has that coffee ice cream aroma shared by manny of the best new-age coffee stouts. Flavors pack a big punch of espresso and fudge. The thick, velvety, luxurious mouthfeel is definitely the high point for me. Reminds me of the mouthfeel on Trillium's pastry stouts when they are successfully executed.",4.29

Bordering full smooth body. Alcohol of 8.1% is absent.
I am in heaven, this is an outstanding DIPA, even after previously drinking some top-level brews. Tropical, green, citrusy, white, dank and bitter! I like the fact that this has a bit more hop character than the average NEIPA. Some still has to fill this gap between the kick ass IPAs and the juicy guys.",4.61

T: Molasses-forward. I love that I pick up the rye character on the flavor, adding an additional depth to the complexity. Finish is bourbon heat with lingering malt/molasses flavor. Moderate bitterness with the perfect pinch of sweetness to round it out.

Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a solid roast/hop bitter/sweet, and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying/acrid flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering hop/char bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic.

All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, maple syrup, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drip on for the big ABV, with the mildly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Amazingly rich/well rounded malt complexity and maple syrup presence; with perfect barrel integration/balance. Not overly roasty/charred on malts, or boozy on barrels. A highly enjoyable offering, and spot on style example as expected.",4.25

6154,The Streets,"It's remarkable that this doesn't come off as boozy at all, given its high ABV! Lots of flavor, but a little too bright/bitter compared to some other Trilliums. Nothing wrong with it. Just some I like better.",4.4
6155,The Streets,"Look - thick slightly orangish yellow with a slight white head and lacing
Smell - so much tropical fruits like pineapple melon and citrus tones with a little peach
Taste - so fruity! Sweet candied apricot with a very slight melon peach. Not sure I get any pineapple
Feel - so thick like I drinking pureed fruit with a slight carbonation which is jus incredible
Overall - really enjoy this!",4.57
6156,The Streets,"Canned on 3/10/21 and enjoyed in a tulip glass. Pours a murky orange color with minimal head but some white lacing that coated the sides of the glass. Really enjoyed the nose of this beer: overripe mango, pineapple, juicy peach, apricot, nectarine. Really thick and syrupy mouthfeel not surprising for a TIPA. Hardly can tell it’s 10+% ABV. This beer has practically ALL the hops, which I thought was kind of a cool concept, given the nod to the Trillium ‘street’ series. This is the first time I’ve tried this anniversary beer and I really enjoyed it. Definitely one that needs to be sipped and savored. Not one I’d necessarily put in a regular rotation if given the opportunity given how heavy it is, so it’s probably fitting that it’s a yearly release and kind of a celebration beer. For now, I’ll enjoy the 3 cans remaining after this one until next year. Cheers.",4.55
6157,The Streets,Billed as a Triple IPA. I’m rating this as an Imperil NEIPA,4.14

6159,The Streets,"16 oz can traded from egrandfield, dated 3/19/19 poured into Rogue IPA glass.",4.38
6160,The Streets,Not always the biggest fan of triples but this is so good . Smell is little hop burn and booze but it is balanced out by the taste some dank notes and good bitterns malt stays I the background,4.47
6161,The Streets,"ASMR feelings in head and spine when I drank this (not just tingling sensation, but a cascading release of dopamine)...I think that speaks for itself. This is undoubtedly the best beer I have ever had. Canned on March 18th; drank on March 18th.",5
6162,The Streets,Man is that thick. So malty! Tastes like an English style IPA. Some throat and chest burn - it's hot. Crisp. Not very bitter. Dank fruit.,4.46
6163,The Streets,"Canned On 05/03/18, 11:10:52.",4.89
6164,The Streets,Really glad I was able to take an extended lunch break to try this much talked about beer.,4.33
6165,The Streets,Poured from a growler I got about a week ago. Great head. I really don’t pick up a lot of smell at all? Sad! Tastes unbelievable though and goes down so easy you’d never guess it has a 10+ ABV,5
6166,The Streets,Poured from a 16oz can into a nonic pint glass.,4.53
6167,The Streets,16oz. can into a Heady Topper stemless snifter. Shared with schen9303.,4.38
6168,The Streets,"Editing this rating to see if it changes my status of having it on the Top 250 list. I drank this back in 2018, so I don't recall the tasting notes, but hopefully I'll now get a check mark next to it on the list! Haha!",4.64
6169,The Streets,"This beer is a masterpiece in the triple IPA category. It's 10.3% ABV, and drinks like any other of their DIPAS.",5
6170,The Streets,"You can smell it from a foot away. Not quite a facsimile for orange juice, but pretty close. This is a Frankenstein hop amalgam. Surprised it has such complexity - a lesser malt base would turn this to a muddled mess. I get lots of different fruits - orange and lime zest give some tang while stone fruits give a nice contrasting unctiousness. It finishes as dry as it can and the body is surprisingly spry for a big beer. Well done, trillium",4.35
6171,The Streets,Not my favorite beer but if they can make a triple ipa taste this good it deserves a perfect score. It’s bitter but you can stilll taste fruitiness in it,5
6172,The Streets,"Had the good fortune to get 24 of these,
Tried this with others and none of us thought it was a 10%.
I loved this one fresh and then I held a can for about 6 months to see where it went, unfortunately it lost all that made it special as they advise DRINK FRESH",4.85
6173,The Streets,Incredible beer. Tasted from can. Robust aroma. Lot of orange with some peach and mango. Very well balanced. Lots of citrus and tropical fruits on flavors. Creamy mouthfeel. Excellent tasting IPA. Overall a top notch IPA even by Trilliums really high standards.,5
6174,The Streets,Cloudy orange appearance with white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is s pleasant citrus. Taste is also a rich citrus that is very smooth and no alcohol aftertaste.,4.52
6175,The Streets,Can dated 3/20/17. This is the third can consumed and a revisit on 6/23/17! Whoa this got better with over 3 months of age on it. From the pop of the can fruit juices hit the nose! Slight sediment when poured and a noce white head leaving spotted lacing. The taste is straight hop juice and 0 bitterness. The feel is full with a slight alcohol burn in the back but that's expected for a 10% abv. Overall it was awesome and my last can so hopefully they do this again.,4.75
6176,The Streets,"Canned 3/20, could only imagine how if was fresher. Poured into a snifter. Color is a very cloudy gold with healthy foam and some seriously big time lacing. Smell is citrusy hops with a mildly bitter undertone. Taste is bold juicy, tangy, citrusy hops with no bitterness. It's a super smooth clean drinking beer with minimal alcohol presence for a 10% abv. Just an amazing beer.",4.84
6177,Second Fiddle,"One of the best tasting fresh beers I've ever had (with an extremely high alcohol content on top of things). Tastes very fresh, with pine and fruit flavors. Splitting a 4 pack is enough for a good night.",4.53
6178,Second Fiddle,"Apparently, I have never reviewed Second Fiddle. That's weird to me, because I first had it probably seven years ago when I first visited Fiddlehead and they had tapped it just before I had arrived. Of course it was fantastic then, living up to my expectations in every possible way, but every time I've had it since then... I must say I've been kinda let down. This batch, however, is from 5/14/21, and is definitely the highest-quality canned batch I've had! It easily eclipses every prior SF iteration I've consumed, and thus I believe it is a fitting entry for a review.",4.44
6179,Second Fiddle,"This is a beautifully made DIPA that I just don't like very much. Beautiful bright amber, with a dense white head, and expected haziness. The aroma is bright, like smelling mint, but very subdued and without any specific aromatic character, except for dankness. The taste is also bright and cool (mint-like), but without any distinct malt or hop flavor that is appealing. (The flavors actually exists for a brief moment , but disappears immediately into a clean bitterness that erases any impression of what you have just drunk.) The body is more like an IPA than a double IPA, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I'm sure this will appeal to those who are looking for a clean, refreshing blast of alcohol, but I'm looking for more aroma and flavor in a DIPA.",2.78
6180,Second Fiddle,1-2 month old can poured into a tulip.,3.99
6181,Second Fiddle,From a 16oz can marked BLONDE NO. 2 03/03/21 13:30,4.43
6182,Second Fiddle,Canned 2/18/21,4.34
6183,Second Fiddle,"This actually pours almost clear if you leave the last ½ ounce in the can. A deep yellow color with a wispy foam and lot's of lacing. Definitely more of a West Coast style DIPA than NE Hazy. Dank and piney, opens up a bit as it warms. Bitter, but still goes down easily. It's one of my personal favorites and I feel is underrated. Available in growlers and 16 ounce cans. New label in February of this year.",4.59
6184,Second Fiddle,"Great beer! Great hit of fresh hop aroma on opening. Also a fan of the ""regular"" IPA from them. My local beer store (MetroWest Massachusetts) has both regularly and they are usually one to two weeks from canning. Not too boozy for a 8.2% so be forewarned ; )",4.56
6185,Second Fiddle,"Picked up a four pack at beer store today and didn't know too much about it. Saw the ratings and I was stoked. This is a well balanced DIPA. I am a big fan of the super hazy NEIPAs and this is not overly smoggy, but it is delicious. This is a great brew for a warm afternoon on the front porch!",4.49
6186,Second Fiddle,I see that all of the other reviews ate from 6 years ago. It apparently has not been brewed for a while so it is possible that this brew is significantly different from the earlier one.,4.43
6187,Second Fiddle,"Hadn't actually heard of this one before managing to grab myself a can. But this was a delight! Really, really solid east coast double. Worth seeking out if available in your area.",4.09
6188,Second Fiddle,"look: yellow, a little dark",4.09
6189,Second Fiddle,"From a 16oz can, dated 11/11/20. Served in an IPA glass.",4.42
6190,Second Fiddle,"Translucent medium orange, with one finger of coarse white head, that leaves a thing ring and slight spotty lacing. Looks like fresh-squeezed tangerine juice, minus the pulp.",4.53
6191,Second Fiddle,"Look...very lovely A-typical hazy Vermont ipa. Hazy yellow brown
Smell...ripe pineapple of the hop boom!!! a little dankness from the yeast ... nice
Taste...Sweet ipa bitter to a cascade of full perfect bitterness. this is my third one and i am really enjoying. Good price or what i expect to pay. I pay for exceptional and don't like paying way over that. This exceeds on both levels.
Feel...A little thin but nice
Overall...this is good and bordering on very good. I will definitely need more to investigate",4.46
6192,Second Fiddle,L: Slightly Hazy orange/yellow with no head and a touch of lacing.,4.46
6193,Second Fiddle,"16oz can. Poured out a clear, golden orange color with a good-sized, off0white head of foam. It left sticky rings of lace on the glass. It smelled of pine, orange juice, mango and pineapple. Big juicy taste with tons of tropical fruit, sweet caramel and a piney bitter punch.",4.5
6194,Second Fiddle,"Look: Hazy golden orange. Fluffy white head.
Smell: Tropical fruit, not sure just what ones, maybe pineapple and orange peel.
Taste: Pineapple, peach and orange, maybe some apricot as well. Good hop presence but not very bitter.
Feel: Not very heavy carbonation, but good.
Overall: A pretty good beer, very drinkable for 8.2% ABV.",4.7
6195,Second Fiddle,"16oz can from Halftime. Hazy golden pour, small silky head. Aroma brings citrusy hops, pure and simple. Taste is more hops, lemony, citrus, that leaves your palate tingling. Slightly dry, sweet, plenty bitter.",4.03
6196,Second Fiddle,Great NEIPA. Has the look and taste that you want from this kind of beer. Hoppy but not too much..I think it beats Sip of Sunshine for flavor and smoothness. (And that says a lot from me).,4.75
6197,Second Fiddle,"Look: fairly clear, but not totally, gold with a very slight lean toward amber",3.03
6198,Second Fiddle,"This can pour is less than 20 days old. The pour is golden with a slight haze and hosts a 2 cm foam cap. The aroma is slight, pine and a bit of. Iris are noted. The flavor is citrus zest, (orange and lime) with prominent pine and a bready malt back. The hop bitterness is moderate. The mouthfeel is crisp. There is no alcohol heat. This Is quite good.",4.1
6199,Second Fiddle,16oz can.,4.18
6200,Second Fiddle,"Fresh - 4-8-20 canning date
Poured out of it's feather-light can at @ 50 deg f allowing a billow of bright white foam to form a sticky head above a golden beer with just the right amount of protein haze - no oaty murk here. Good, steady streams of carbonation race to the surface to die or join the few scant bubbles around the edge of the tulip belly. A head will kick up again if gently swirled but fades quickly.
Sharp aromas of citrus and sugary malt in balance are beaten back by boozy notes as it warms. And warms it does as you swallow and savor the piney/ citrus flavors that get heated by the alcohol - yes warm it do, all the way down.
The hops - it is all about the hops in a DIPA right? Well, I say balance is but thats just me . This like many, is harsh on the back end - maybe just for me but it does go well with the hot mildly boozy finish so it ticks all the boxes for a solid DIPA. Great medium ++ body and tongue wrapping hop bite, nice nose but could be richer with better balance and mouth feel, aftertaste is just harsh bitter with a warming alcoholic finish .",3.92
6201,Second Fiddle,"Canned 02-05, pours a slightly cloudy golden with a small white cap that fades to a ring. Aromas are subdued with only slight notes of citrus and pine mixed with a really nice doughy/crackery malt. Flavors are another story altogether! Immediate burst of vegetal hops and somewhat bitter pith character. Mouthfeel is fairly light for the abv, and the finish is slightly bitter AND slightly sweet simultaneously. Nice change of pace.",4.21
6202,Dragonsaddle,"pungent flavors of sharp pineapple, pulpy and slightly acidic orange juice, some minty and pine character, a hint of doughy sweetness and a mélange of smooth fruity flavors. however as it warms I do get this sort of unpleasant chalky character on the back end that has a bit of a peppery spice to it. good flavor but just a bit rough around the edges.",4.17
6203,Dragonsaddle,Canned on 9/30/20; consumed on 10/18/20,4.15
6204,Dragonsaddle,"Late check in, reviewed from notes.",4.5
6205,Dragonsaddle,"Special release beer from HH that stands out among their impeccable lineup of strong Double and Triple NEIPAs. Insanely well masked alcohol at double digit ABV and intense complex bouquet of tropical tasting notes. Worth the hype, but need to drink fresh.",4.75
6206,Dragonsaddle,"Not to be cliche, but this monster hides the alcohol content extremely well. Super juicy, big pillowy body, and doesn’t carry the sharpness you get from a lot of triples. Finishes clean. Outstanding.",4.88
6207,Dragonsaddle,"Poured into a Hoof Teku. Smell is strong with lots of citrus coming through. Graperfruit, papaya, some orange. Taste follows suit. Absolutely excellent triple IPA. Unbelievably smooth, does not feel like 11.5% at all.",4.59
6208,Dragonsaddle,"This is the upper echelon of of triple IPA’s. The aroma is full of citrus fruit and tropical notes, coming at my nose with waves of dank hops, lots of grapefruit, tangerine and sweet grassy notes. Flavor is super juicy and full of citrus with tangerine, mango, guava, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, faint lemon zest, some lactose sugar or a creamy essence, then it brings sweet malt, grains, floral notes and graham cracker. It hides the ABV masterfully and is a terrific representation of this style.",4.56
6209,Dragonsaddle,"Poured into a snifter. Very hazy bright yellow color with a modest white head. Big tropical, grassy, and earthy aroma. Taste followed: pineapple, berries, mango, grass, and dank flavors. Smooth, full-bodied, and soft bitterness. One of my favorite TIPAs.",4.41
6210,Dragonsaddle,"Amazing Triple IPA! Definitely one of the best I've ever drank! I was able to try this from a pretty old can, and even still it was hazy and super delicious. Very lucky to drink an all-time great!!",4.78
6211,Dragonsaddle,Another awesome IPA from Hoof.,5
6212,Dragonsaddle,"Drinking from a 16oz can into glass. I have a hunch that perhaps this can has been sitting around for a while as the aroma and taste is very muted and borderline stale (dare I say). Even still its a tasty big beer, with a surprisingly thin body for 11.5%. Not top shelf worthy, at least not the can I drank from.",4.2
6213,Dragonsaddle,"To me, this is about as close to a perfect beer. The best part is how hidden the alcohol is. Sure you can't crush a bunch of these but just one could be just enough. With it's limits, that makes perfect sense to me.",4.98
6214,Dragonsaddle,"Tasted from can. Pours a cloudy yellow with nice fluffy white head. Aroma is big time tropical fruits. Lots of pineapple, mango, papaya and a hint of pine. Moderately bitter. Hides ABV extremely well. Huge tropical fruit flavor taste similar to aroma with some dank notes. Top notch imperial ipa.",4.94
6215,Dragonsaddle,"Hazy as all get out, and mango fruit punch for days - I've had a lot from Hoof Hearted, but this is by far their masterpiece. Good luck believing it's a Triple IPA too, because it drinks like a single! One of my new favorites.",4.79
6216,Dragonsaddle,The beer comes in a hazy medium gold color.,4.74
6217,Dragonsaddle,"Pours a hazy golden color with pure white head. Aroma is lots of tropical fruit. Flavor follows the nose with big notes of papaya, mango and citrus. Has a bit of bitterness on the back end with a clean citrus peel aftertaste. Has a nice drinkable body and overall very delicious.",4.58
6218,Dragonsaddle,From can. Pours a milky orange. Very impressive head for a trip/abv. Sticky lacing stays in place well. Minimal booze in the nose. Honeydew and grapefruit rind? Great smell anyhow. Very sweet to mask abv. Noticeable carb but an overall smooth finish. Nice and sticky. Solid beer.,4.46
6219,Dragonsaddle,"Poured from the can into a tulip. Huge beer, but pretty easy drinking considering the ABV. Tropical fruit, minimal bitterness, solid mouthfeel. Really solid triple IPA!",4.29
6220,Dragonsaddle,"L: standard TIPA color nothing special looking but very good looking
S: fruit fruit fruit butter hops barely detectable to me
T: no Dankiness to this to me just pure juice pineapple mango etc. exotic and delicious. Such a surprise. Alcohol so well hidden it's impressive the taste is beautiful.
F: thick but not too viscous good mouthfeel good chug this one back until blackout.
O: i had this on tap at Shelton brothers festival and it made the biggest impact on me. I did not expect this to be so delicious and drinkable I told them I would kill for this to be available in Louisville. Such a fantastic beer better than any IPA style I tried at the festival. Fantastic beer perfectly balanced. Whatever they were going for they hit on the head I do like some bready malt backbone in my DIPAS and trips but this is exception to the rule fantastic beer will seek out in the future.",4.99
6221,Dragonsaddle,Surprisingly one of the better triple ipas out there. Not overly bitter and weedy/dank.,4.38
6222,Dragonsaddle,"For me, I have experienced all of the hoof hearted beers I have wanted to sample. This.... this is the best by far. It is absolutely delicious with every sip you take. It has only gotten better with age. I can't really describe it too much. The aroma is pineapple, mango, peach, orange. The taste is straight juice with some hop bitterness. And the alcohol is covered so well that I can't even seem to distinguish where it begins and ends. It is one of the best examples of what this brewery can do and one of the best beers I have had all year. I truly love this beer and the 16.99 I paid for the four pack (x3 because I bought 3 total 4 packs) is well worth it. I think they have finally found there stride at hoof. I had roller blabe and didn't enjoy it till I waited 5 weeks post batch. South of Eleven was excellent. I really liked Konkey Dong. And this beer... this beer is truly why I drink the style. I just absolutely love it! I hope they can brew it more then once a year, but if that is the case... I will be back next year! Great job Hoof. You have finally made me want to consistently go to every release!",4.75
6223,Dragonsaddle,fresh can drank on 11/5/2016,4.5
6224,Dragonsaddle,"1 PINT can
Served in an oversized stemless wine glass",4.4
6225,Dragonsaddle,"L: Pours a dark gold with a nice head that stays around a bit.
S: Dank with some citrus. And with some candy in there. Smells very sweet for how much alcohol is packed into here.
T: Dank and more dank. This reminds me of heady topper as if it became a triple. The citrus is toned down, but the candy comes through on the taste more than it did on the nose, and moreso than any IPA I've had. But without being sugary or sweek - it complements the dank & juice. It's a really enjoyable drink, and the flavors come out even more as it warms a bit.
F - Super smooth, again very much reminds me of heady topper.
O - Amazing beer, really glad to have tried it.",4.79
6226,Dragonsaddle,"First beer I've given a 5 across the board..best IPA I've had to date, this is a deceptive beer it drinks like a TH double IPA but is so slam packed with fruity hops and more hazy..oh yeah and it's 11.5%, I've never tried a beer that hides it's booze content this well, a hazy delight.",5
